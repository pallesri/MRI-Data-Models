inhibited	O

Next	O

we	O

that	O
these	O

We	O

we	O

The	O
most	O

explanation	O
is	O
that	O
the	O

not	O
exist	O
,	O
or	O
its	O
distribution	O

Although	O

Alternatively	O

may	O
have	O
the	O
23rd	O

This	O
is	O
because	O

is	O
limited	O

our	O

In	O
either	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
distribution	O
of	O
the	O
23rd	O

will	O
be	O

Yet	O
another	O
possibility	O

that	O
the	O

but	O
is	O
not	O

well	O

that	O
the	O

that	O

Zhang	O

this	O

that	O

Our	O

The	O

leads	O
to	O
precocious	O
changes	O

We	O

that	O
the	O

has	O
additional	O
effects	O
on	O
the	O

One	O
possible	O
explanation	O
for	O
the	O
developmental	O
delay	O
and	O
failure	O
to	O
pupariate	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
adgf-a	O
mutation	O
affects	O
the	O
production	O
or	O
release	O
of	O
ecdysteroid	O
hormones	O
from	O
the	O
major	O
endocrine	O
organ	O
of	O
the	O
Drosophila	O
larva—the	O
ring	O
gland	O

This	O
is	O
supported	O
by	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
pupariation	O
rate	O
and	O
survival	O
of	O
the	O
adgf-a	O
mutant	O
can	O
be	O
significantly	O
improved	O
by	O
expression	O
of	O
transgenic	O
ADGF-A	O
in	O
the	O
ring	O
gland	O
and	O
salivary	O
glands	O
.	O

We	O
suggest	O
that	O
this	O
somehow	O
interferes	O
with	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
hormone	O
release	O
.	O

Other	O
mutants	O
with	O
hormonal	O

Presumably	O
the	O
elevated	O
adenosine	O
in	O
the	O
adgf-a	O
mutant	O
blocks	O
the	O
production	O
or	O
release	O
of	O
ecdysone	O
from	O
the	O
ring	O
gland	O
by	O
an	O
unknown	O
mechanism	O

This	O
idea	O
is	O
supported	O
by	O
our	O
finding	O
that	O
both	O
pupariation	O
rate	O
and	O
survival	O
of	O
the	O
adgf-a	O

can	O
also	O
be	O
improved	O

in	O
the	O
diet	O

Thus	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O
adgf-a	O
mutant	O
is	O
arrested	O
in	O
development	O
due	O
to	O
an	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
mutation	O
on	O
hormone	O
production	O
from	O
the	O
ring	O
gland	O
.	O

The	O
arrest	O
of	O
development	O
in	O
the	O
adgf-a	O
mutants	O
was	O
significantly	O
suppressed	O
by	O
loss	O
of	O
the	O
adenosine	O
receptor	O
caused	O
by	O
the	O
adoR	O
mutation	O
:	O
larvae	O
simply	O
homozygous	O
for	O
adgf-a	O
pupated	O

Therefore	O

play	O
a	O
role	O
in	O
the	O

this	O

we	O
have	O

we	O

an	O
interaction	O

the	O
