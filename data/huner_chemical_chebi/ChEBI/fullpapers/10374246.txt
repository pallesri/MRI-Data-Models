   Nausea and vomiting are frequent side effects caused by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Traditional Chinese herbal drugs with  anti-emetic potential can be used to prevent them. However, the effects of anti-emetic active principles of these crude drugs  need to be studied using modern pharmacological methods. One of the difficul­ties in testing for anti-emetic activity of  natural prod­ucts is the selection of adequate animal models.  We previously reported anti-emetic principles from Magnolia obovata bark, Zingiber officinale rhizome (Kawai et al., 1994),  Inula linariaefolia flowers and Forsythia suspensa fruits (Kinoshita et al., 1996), and Poria cocos (Tai et al., 1995) using  frogs as test sub­jects. The long emetic latency of frogs induced by the emetic agent was not suitable for testing many  samples within a short period of time. Therefore, we studied a new screening method using chicks for anti-emetic ac­tivity  (Akita et al., 1998) to overcome these difficulties.  The present paper describes the screening of 31 ex­tracts from 8 traditional Chinese herbal drugs for anti­emetic activities,  using young chicks, and the identifica­tion of some of the active principles contained in Po­gostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth.

The structures of active compounds isolated from Pogostemon cab/in Benth   which showed the highest anti-emetic activity (58.6 %) was chromatographed on a silica gel column (n-hex­ane: EtOAc), and 8  fractions (fr, 1-8) obtained.  Each fraction was tested for anti-emetic activity, and fro 2, fro 3, fro 7 showed positive activity (Table 2). Fraction 2 was  subjected to HPLC using a silica gel co­lumn [Silica-4251-N 10 0 X 250 mm, n-Hexane­EtOAc (11:1)], and compound 1 (l.72g) was  obtained and identified as patchouli alcohol by comparison with published spectral data (Barton et al., 1987).  An active fraction, fro 3, was chromatographed on a silica gel column (n-hexane: acetone) and HPLC using a silica gel column  [Silica-4251-N 100 X 250mm, n­Hexane-EtOAc (5:1)]. Compounds 2 (79.7 mg) and 3  (41.3 mg) were identified as pogostol and stigmast-4­en-S-one by comparison with published spectral data (Hikino et al., 1968;  Greca et al., 1990).  Fraction 7 was subjected to on HPLC using a silica gel column [Silica-4251-N 100 X 250mm, n-Hexane­acetone (75:25)], and  compounds 4 (62.6 mg) and 5  (48.0 mg) were obtained and examined by MS, lH_ and 13C-NMR, DEPT experiment, IH_13C COSY, IH_13C long range COSY (COLOq and  the difference of Overhauser enhancement (nOe) spectra. These obser­  vations suggested that compounds 4 and 5 were retusin and pachypodol, respectively.       Results and Discussion   As shown in Table 1,20 extracts significantly inhibited emetic action induced by CUS04 in young chicks. The n-hexane, CHCl3  and MeOH extracts of Pogostemon cablin showed significant inhibition at a dose of 300 mg/kg. Patchouli alcohol (1), pogostol  (2), stigmast-4­en-3-one (3), retusin (4) and pachypodol (5) previously isolated from the n-hexane extract (Barton et al.,  1987; Hinoki et al., 1968; Greca et al., 1990; Dominquez et al., 1968; Valesi et al., 1972) also showed anti-emetic activity  Patchouli alcohol (1) was active at two doses of 50 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg. Pogostol (2) significantly inhibit­ed emetic action at  three doses of 10 mg/kg-50 mg/kg. Stigmast-4-en-3-one (3) and pachypodol (5) showed anti-emetic activity at doses of 50 mg/kg.  Retusin (4) inhibited emetic action at two doses of 20 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg.  Pogostemon cablin is one of the traditional Chinese medicines used mainly for the treatment of dyspepsia, vomiting, diarrhea  and poor appetite. It is also known that inward Ca2+ influx through the cell membranes may induce excessive excitation of  smooth muscles, and excessive contraction of digestive organ muscles may cause vomiting and diarrhea. Therefore, the Ca2 +  antagonist is expected to alleviate those symptoms by depressing excessive contraction of digestive organ muscles. It has been  reported that patchouli alcohol showed Ca2+ antagonist activity in vitro (Ichikawa et al., 1989). These results indicate that  the anti-emetic activity of patchouli alcohol may be due to depressing excessive contraction of digestive organ muscles by  in­hibition of inward Ca2+ influx through the cell embra­nes. Patchouli alcohol contained abundantly in Po­gostemon cablin (>  0.1 %) may playa main role in anti-emetic effect clinically in view of its traditional use in Chinese medicine.
