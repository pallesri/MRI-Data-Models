 Erbland and Marinetti [1]  first demonstrated the presence of transacylase activity in liver supernatant to transfer the acyl group from 1-acyl-sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-acyl-GPC) to a second molecule of 1-acyl-GPC, producing phosphatidylcholine (PC). By purifying the enzyme from rat lung, Brumley and van den Bosch [2]  demonstrated that the transacylase activity was a second activity of lysophospholipase and responsible for the synthesis of disaturated PC, abundantly found in lung surfactant [3] . Transacylation activity is not associated with all lysophospholipases, but one class of isoform with molecular masses of about 60 kDa, called lysophospholipase-transacylase. The activity is thought to be due to the intermediate formation of the acyl-enzyme during the enzyme reaction. Lysophospholipase-transacylase was purified from various tissues, such as liver [4] , heart [5] , and lung [2] . We recently cloned cDNA for the hepatic enzyme and showed that it comprised 564 amino acid residues [6] . The amino-terminal two-thirds of the molecule resembled Escherichia coli  asparaginase I [7]  with the putative catalytic triad Thr-Asp-Lys, followed by the leucine zipper motif. The carboxyl-terminal region contained the ankyrin repeat [8,9] . This structure is markedly different from the other class of lysophospholipase lacking transacylase activity with a molecular mass of about 25 kDa, comprising 230 amino acids with the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly esterase/lipase consensus and the catalytic triad Ser119 -Asp174 -His208 [10–12] . In the previous study, we showed that rat liver 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase transferred the palmitoyl residue from 1-palmitoyl-GPC to a second molecule of 1-palmitoyl-GPC, and also to 2-palmitoyl-sn -glycerol (hereafter 2-palmitoylglycerol), producing 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC and 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol, respectively [4] . To extend these findings, we characterized the transacylation activity of the enzyme in more detail. The obtained results indicate that the enzyme can transfer saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl chains from 1-acyl-GPC to the sn -1(3) and sn -2 positions of acyl acceptors and also from 2-acyl-GPC to the sn -1 position of acyl acceptors. Notably, the enzyme transferred the arachidonoyl residue from the sn -2 position of the donor lipid to the sn -1 position of the acceptor lipid. When the enzyme was incubated with 2-arachidonoyl-GPC, arachidonic acid was transferred from one molecule of 2-arachidonoyl-GPC to another molecule of 2-arachidonoyl-GPC, producing 1,2-diarachidonoyl-GPC. The present results suggest that 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase mediates the synthesis of 1-arachidonoyl PC, an important precursor of the intrinsic cannabinol receptor ligand, anandamide [13,14] .  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials 1-Palmitoyl-GPC was obtained from Bachem Feinchemikalien AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). 1-Palmitoyl-sn -glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (1-palmitoyl-GPE), 1-acyl-sn -glycero-3-phospho-myo -inositol (1-acyl-GPI), and 1-acyl-sn -glycero-3-phosphoserine (1-acyl-GPS) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). 1-Stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPC and 1(3)- and 2-palmitoylglycerol were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Glycerol was purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). 1-[14 C]Palmitoyl-GPC (55 mCi/mmol), 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC (55 mCi/mmol), and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC (55 mCi/mmol) were from Amersham (UK). Silica Gel 60 plates were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Rhizopus arrhizus  lipase was from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany).  2.2 Preparation of 2-[14 C]palmitoyl- and 2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC Two hundred nanomoles of 1-palmitoyl-2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC (21.6 dpm/pmol) or 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC (17.7 dpm/pmol) was treated with R. arrhizus  lipase for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2  and 0.02% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 0.6 ml. 2-[14 C]Palmitoyl- and 2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC produced were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) and separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (65:25:4:1, by volume) as the first solvent and chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (30:40:10:7:5, by volume) as the second solvent. The TLC band containing 2-[14 C]palmitoyl- or [14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC was located by autoradiography, scraped off, extracted with methanol, and dispersed in 90 μl of distilled water using a Branson B-220 sonifier for 20 s at an output of 125 W, and then immediately used to minimize acyl migration.  2.3 Enzyme purification Sixty-kiloDalton lysophospholipase-transacylase was purified from rat liver as described previously [4]  with some modification. We found that the G-butyl column chromatography step sometimes gave a poor yield of the enzyme, but could be removed without any serious effect on the purity of the final enzyme preparation. Glycerol (10%) was used instead of dimethylsulfoxide in S-200 column chromatography.  2.4 Lysophospholipase assay The activity was isotopically assayed as described previously [4] .  2.5 Acyl transfer from the sn-1 to the sn-1(3) position The purified enzyme was incubated for 40 min at 37°C in 0.1-ml of the indicated buffer containing 0.2 mM 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC (3 500 dpm/nmol) as acyl donor, and the indicated concentration of glycerol or 2-palmitoylglycerol as acyl acceptor. The reaction was terminated by adding 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume), followed by the addition of 0.6 ml of distilled water. The mixture was shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 2000×g  for 5 min. The lower phase was evaporated to dryness in a CVE-100 centrifugal vaporizer (Tokyo Rika, Tokyo, Japan), dissolved in a minimum volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) and separated by two-dimensional TLC. The acylation product of glycerol was developed with solvent system I (first dimension, chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (65:25:4:1, by volume); second dimension, chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (30:40:10:7:5, by volume)). The acylation product of 2-palmitoylglycerol was separated with solvent system II (first dimension, n -hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, by volume); second dimension, chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (65:25:4:1, by volume)). The lipids were located by autoradiography, scraped off the plate, and quantitated by counting in a toluene/Triton X-100 scintillant. The identity of each TLC spot was ascertained by co-chromatography with authentic samples. Steric isomers of palmitoylglycerol were identified on a borate-impregnated silica gel H plate with chloroform/acetone (1:1, by volume) as the developing solvent [15] .  2.6 Acyl transfer from the sn-1 to the sn-2 position The enzyme was incubated with 0.2 mM 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC as acyl donor and 0.2 mM 1-palmitoyl-GPE, 1-acyl-GPI, or 1-acyl-GPS as acyl acceptor. The other conditions were as described above. The product lipids were extracted and separated by two-dimensional TLC using the solvent system I and counted as above.  2.7 Acyl transfer from the sn-2 to the sn-1 position Two methods were used. In method I, the enzyme was incubated with 0.2 mM 2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC (21 600 dpm/nmol) or 2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC (17 700 dpm/nmol), and the reaction product was extracted, separated on TLC with the solvent system I, and then quantitated as above. In method II, 10 nmol each of 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC (20 000 dpm) and 1,2-dioleoyl-GPE were preincubated with 12.5 U of R. arrhizus  lipase at 37°C in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM CaCl2 , and 0.02% Triton X-100. After 20 min of incubation, 0.1 μg of purified 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase and 2.5 μmol of phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) were added and incubated at 37°C for 40 min in a total volume of 100 μl. Lipids were extracted, separated with the solvent system I, and then quantitated as described above. All the data presented herein were repeated at least twice and the representative data are shown.   3 Results 3.1 Acylation of glycerol and 2-acylglycerol with 1-acyl-GPC (sn-1 to -1(3) transfer) When 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase was incubated with 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC, we noted the spot of monoacylglycerol on a two-dimensional TLC plate in addition to those of palmitic acid and dipalmitoyl-GPC (data not shown). Since the enzyme contained 10% glycerol as the stabilizing agent, we thought that the monoacylglycerol was derived from the acylation of glycerol contained in the enzyme preparation. To confirm this, increasing concentrations of glycerol were supplemented to the incubation and monoacylglycerol synthesis was examined. As shown in Fig. 1  , monoacylglycerol synthesis was stimulated by the substrate glycerol, but inhibited at high concentrations. The optimum pH of monoacylglycerol synthesis was 9.0. However, the glycerol concentration required for the maximal monoacylglycerol synthesis (40%) was much higher than the reported glycerol content of rat liver (2.7 μg/g wet weight) [16] . Thus, the acylation of glycerol by lysoPC may not have physiological significance in the liver. To determine which carbon of the glycerol backbone was acylated, we separated the palmitoylglycerol formed from 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC and glycerol on a borate-impregnated silicic acid plate [15]  to separate sn -1(3)- and 2-isomer. 1(3)-Palmitoylglycerol migrated more slowly than 2-palmitoylglycerol because boric acid complexed with vicinal hydroxy groups. As shown in Fig. 2  , the product from 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC and glycerol was identified as the 1(3)-palmitoylglycerol. Thus glycerol was acylated in a regiospecific manner by the enzyme. When 2-palmitoylglycerol was used as acyl acceptor, 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol was produced (Fig. 3  ). 1,3-Dipalmitoylglycerol was not produced (data not shown). 1,2-Dipalmitoylglycerol formation was maximal with 0.4 mM 2-palmitoylglycerol with optimum pH at 6.0. The transacylation was slightly stimulated (25%) by 2 mM Mg2+ . In the presence of 0.4 mM 2-palmitoylglycerol and 2 mM Mg2+  at pH 6.0, 1,2-diacylglycerol formation was 40% of PC formation. Thus, 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase catalyzed the following sn -1 to -1 acyl transfer reactions:1-acyl-GPC+glycerol→1(3)-acylglycerol+GPC    1-acyl-GPC+2-acylglycerol→1,2-diacylglycerol+GPC .     3.2 Acylation of 1-acyl lysophospholipids with 1-acyl-GPC (sn-1 to -2 transfer) We examined whether or not the enzyme was able to utilize different 1-acyl lysophospholipids as acyl acceptor. The purified enzyme was incubated with 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC and 0.2 mM 1-acyl lysophospholipids (1-palmitoyl-GPE, 1-acyl-GPI, or 1-acyl-GPS) at pH 6.0, and the radioactive products were separated by two-dimensional TLC and quantitated. When 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC was used as the sole substrate, radioactive product was [14 C]dipalmitoyl-GPC (Fig. 3 ). However, when 1-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC was incubated with 1-palmitoyl-GPE, 1-acyl-GPI, or 1-acyl-GPS, [14 C]PC was decreased, and varying amounts of 1-palmitoyl-2[14 C]palmitoyl-GPE, 1-acyl-2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPI, and 1-acyl-2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPS were produced. The total acyl transfer (PC+PE, PC+PI, and PC+PS syntheses) varied with the lysophospholipids used, suggesting the modulation of transferase activity by lysophospholipids. The amount of [14 C]PE produced was about half the amount of [14 C]PC, indicating that 1-palmitoyl-GPE was a fairly good acyl acceptor. However, when 1-acyl-GPI and 1-acyl-GPS were used as acyl acceptor, only low levels of [14 C]PI and [14 C]PS were produced, indicating that 1-acyl-GPI and 1-acyl-GPS were rather poor acyl acceptors although the former was somewhat better than the latter. Thus, the effectiveness of lysophospholipids as acyl acceptor was in the order: 1-palmitoyl-GPC>1-palmitoyl-GPE>1-acyl-GPI>1-acyl-GPS. This order agreed fairly well with the specificity of the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme [4] . Thus, the enzyme catalyzed the following sn -1 to -2 transacylation:1-acyl-GPC+1-acyl-GPX (GPC>GPE>GPI>GPS)→1,2-diacyl-GPX (GPC>GPE>GPI>GPS)+GPX (GPC>GPE>GPI>GPS) .     3.3 Acylation of 2-acyl-GPC with 2-acyl-GPC (sn-2 to -1 transfer) We next examined whether or not the enzyme utilized 2-acyl-GPC as the substrate. We prepared 2-[14 C]arachidonoyl- and 2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC from 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC, respectively, by treatment with R. arrhizus  lipase that specifically cleaved the sn -1 acyl residue of phospholipids. The 2-acyl-GPCs thus prepared were separated by two-dimensional TLC. Since 2-acyl-GPC is known to be gradually converted to the 1-acyl isomer via acyl migration in vitro [12,17] , the 2-acyl-GPC extracted was immediately used for the assay. The enzyme was incubated with 2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC or 2-[14 C]palmitoyl-GPC at pH 6.0, and the reaction products were analyzed by two-dimensional TLC. As shown in Fig. 4  , free fatty acid was released from each substrate, indicating that the enzyme can hydrolyze the ester bond at the sn -2 position. The hydrolytic rate for 2-palmitoyl-GPC was 0.57 μmol/min/mg, about one-third the rate for the sn -1 isomer. 2-Arachidonoyl-GPC was cleaved at a rate of 0.4 μmol/min/mg. In addition to fatty acid, PC and monoacylglycerol were observed on TLC, indicating that transacylation occurred from 2-acyl-GPC to a second molecule of 2-acyl-GPC. Monoacylglycerol was formed by transacylation from 2-acyl-GPC to glycerol contained in the enzyme. 1,2-Diarachidonoyl PC was synthesized from two molecules of 2-arachidonoyl-GPC at a rate of 0.23 μmol/min/mg, almost three times greater than the rate of dipalmitoyl PC synthesis (0.082 μmol/min/mg). To confirm the above results, we used an alternative method, lipase-coupling assay, to determine the sn -2 to -1 transacylase activity of the enzyme. This method utilized the 2-acyl-GPC- and 2-acyl-GPE-generating systems as acyl donor and acceptor, respectively. Briefly, 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC and 1,2-dioleoyl-GPE were mixed with Rhizopus  lipase and purified 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase and incubated. Radioactive lipid products were separated by two-dimensional TLC and analyzed. We expected that radioactive PE, easily separable from the substrate PC, would be produced by transacylation from 2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC to 2-oleoyl-GPE generated from the added PC and PE. Fig. 5   shows that radioactive PE was indeed formed in the presence of lysophospholipase-transacylase and lipase. However, when lysophospholipase-transacylase was omitted, radioactive PE was not produced. These results confirm the above results that the enzyme mediated the sn -2 to -1 acyl transfer. Furthermore, the autoradiogram shows that much more [14 C]arachidonic acid was released from 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC by the combined action of lysophospholipase-transacylase and Rhizopus  lipase than lipase alone. Fig. 6   shows the time course of arachidonic acid release from 1-stearoyl-2-[14 C]arachidonoyl-GPC in the presence of lysophospholipase-transacylase and Rhizopus  lipase. When lysophospholipase-transacylase was omitted, arachidonic acid release decreased greatly. These results are consistent with the above findings that the 60-kDa enzyme mediated the cleavage of not only the sn -1, but also sn -2 ester bonds. Taken together, the results indicate that rat liver 60-kDa lysophospholipase catalyzes the following reactions:2-arachidonoyl (or palmitoyl)-GPC+H2 O→arachidonic acid (or palmitic acid)+GPC,    2-arachidonoyl or (palmitoyl)-GPC+2-arachidonoyl (or palmitoyl)-GPC→1,2-diarachidonoyl (or dipalmitoyl)-GPC+GPC,    2-arachidonoyl (or palmitoyl)-GPC+glycerol→arachidonoylglycerol (or palmitoylglycerol)+GPC,    2-arachidonoyl-GPC+2-acyl-GPE→1-arachidonoyl-2-acyl-GPE+GPC .      4 Discussion Erbland and Marinetti [1]  first described the production of PC from two molecules of lysoPC in liver supernatant. This activity was ascribed to a second activity of lysophospholipase by partial purification of the lung enzyme [2] . We previously observed that the lysophospholipase activity of liver supernatant was separated into three peaks by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The first and second peaks exhibited only hydrolase activity, but the third peak exhibited not only lysophospholipase, but also transacylase activities [4] . We purified and cloned all three enzyme peaks [6,10,18] . The lysophospholipase exhibiting transacylase, named 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase, comprised 564 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 60 794 Da. The present investigation showed that the enzyme can catalyze three types of transacylation reactions: (1) acyl transfer from 1-acyl-GPC to the sn -1(3) positions of glycerol and 2-acylglycerol (sn -1 to -1(3) transfer); (2) acyl transfer from 1-acyl-GPC to the sn -2 positions of 1-acyl-GPC, 1-acyl-GPE, and other lysophospholipids (sn -1 to -2 transfer); and (3) acyl transfer from 2-acyl-GPC to the sn -1 position of 2-acyl-GPC and 2-acyl-GPE (sn -2 to -1 transfer). The sn -1 to -2 transfer from 1-acyl lysophospholipid to a second molecule of 1-acyl lysophospholipid is a well-known activity of lysophospholipase-transacylase [1,2,4,5] . Since fatty acid esterified at the sn -1 position is normally saturated [19] , this activity was thought to be important for the synthesis of disaturated species of phospholipids abundantly found in pulmonary surfactant [3,19] . The other two activities, the sn -1 to -1(3) and sn -2 to -1 transfers, had not been previously described for lysophospholipase. It is interesting to note that cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 , which also exhibits lysophospholipase activity, was reported to mediate a similar transacylation reaction, the acylation of glycerol with 1-palmitoyl-GPC [20] . The sn -2 to -1 transfer activity of 60-kDa lysophospholipase is of special interest. To the best of our knowledge, this activity had not been reported for any other transacylases. Mammalian cells possess the phospholipid remodeling system to modify the fatty acid composition of the newly synthesized phospholipids. Arachidonic acid is incorporated into phospholipids by such remodeling systems at the sn -2 position of the glycerol backbone. All the known transacylases involved in phospholipid remodeling introduce arachidonic acid into the sn -2 position to form 2-arachidonoyl phospholipids. Lysophospholipid acyltransferase acylates the sn -2 position of 1-acyl lysophospholipids with arachidonoyl-CoA [21,22] . CoA-dependent transacylase which utilizes the existing diacyl phospholipids as acyl donor also transfers arachidonic acid to the sn -2 position of 1-acyl lysophospholipids [23,24] . CoA-independent transacylase catalyzes the incorporation of arachidonic acid from the sn -2 position of phospholipid to the sn -2 position of 1-alkyl-GPC [25]  or 1-alkenyl-GPE [26] . Thus, 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase is unique in its ability to synthesize 1-arachidonoyl species of phospholipids by transferring the arachidonoyl residue from 2-arachidonoyl lysophospholipid to the sn -1 position of 2-acyl lysophospholipid. Although 1-arachidonoyl species of phospholipids are rather rare in mammalian tissues, they may play important roles in cellular functions. For example, 1-arachidonoyl PC is required for the synthesis of the intrinsic cannabinol receptor ligand, arachidonoylethanolamide or anandamide which plays crucial roles in brain and other tissues [27] . Anandamide is produced from N -arachidonoyl-PE by the phospholipase D-mediated phosphodiester bond cleavage [13,14,28] . N -Arachidonoyl-PE is synthesized by the transfer of the arachidonoyl residue from 1-arachidonoyl PC to the ethanolamine moiety of PE [13,29] . However, the mechanism of 1-arachidonoyl PC formation had not been clarified. The present study showed that 1-arachidonoyl PC can be produced from 2-arachidonoyl-GPC by the sn -2 to -1 transacylation activity of lysophospholipase-transacylase. Pete et al. [30,31]  showed that the brain tissue contained a high level of phospholipase A1  and possessed the PC degradation pathway by which PC was sequentially deacylated first by phospholipase A1  and then by lysophospholipase. Thus, it is very likely that 2-arachidonoyl-GPC is formed as the intermediate of PC degradation in brain and probably in other tissues as well, and utilized for the synthesis of 1-arachidonoyl species of PC by lysophospholipase-transacylase.
