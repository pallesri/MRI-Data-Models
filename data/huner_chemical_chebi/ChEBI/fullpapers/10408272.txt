 The growing demand for peptides with biological, pharmaceutical and food ingredients applications requires the development of efficient synthetic methods [1] . Recently, the successful performance of enzymatic peptide synthesis in heterogenous substrate mixtures [2–5] has provided a new and efficient route to peptide syntheses. It was found that some amino acid amides can form supercooled liquid mixtures with N -carbobenzyloxy-l -tyrosine ethyl ester (CBZ-Tyroet) and acetyl-l -tyrosine ethyl ester (Ac-Tyroet), in which enzymic catalysis of transesterfication reactions can take place. For example, the dipeptide (N -CBZ-Tyr-leuNH) was obtained in the supercooled liquid mixtures of l -leucinamide with CBZ-Tyroet when subtilisin or α-chymotrypsin were used. However, the enzymatic peptide synthesis in the absence of solvent depends on the ability of the mixtures to form supercooled liquid mixtures [2–5] . For instance, supercooled-liquid mixtures cannot be formed on mixing l -leucinamide and N -trifluoroacetyl-l -tyrosine ethyl ester (TFAc-Tyroet) and no dipeptide can be obtained. It is therefore important to understand the mechanism of the formation of supercooled liquid in the mixtures of amino acid amides and tyrosine derivatives. As part of the systematic study of amino acid derivatives, the proton relaxation behaviour and crystal structure of l -leucinamide [6, 7] and the proton relaxation of l -alaninamide [8] has been studied. It was found that methyl group and amino group rotations are the main spin-lattice relaxation mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the NMR proton relaxation behaviours of three tyrosine derivatives, namely, Ac-Tyroet, CBZ-Tyroet, TFAc-Tyroet (Fig. 1  ), and their mixtures with l -leucinamide in order to understand the molecular dynamics of these compounds and the contributions of molecular motions in the formation of supercooled liquids.  2 Experimental 2.1 Sample preparation 2.1.1 N-carbobenzyloxy-l -tyrosine ethyl ester (CBZ-Tyroet) CBZ-Tyroet was prepared from the corresponding free acid using the thionyl chloride method [9] . A 10 g N -carbobenzyloxy-l -tyrosine (Sigma) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (BDH) and 2.8 ml of thionyl chloride (Sigma) was slowly added in. The reaction was carried out at 40°C for 2 h in a water bath located in a fume cupboard, followed by rotary evaporation. The products were then dissolved in ethyl acetate (BDH) and washed by 0.1 M aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (Sigma) solution 3 or 4 times to remove non-reacted N -carbobenzyloxy-l -tyrosine. To dry the ethyl acetate solution, an excess of magnesium sulphate (BDH) was added, followed by filtration and rotary evaporation. The CBZ-Tyroet was then crystallised from hot ethyl acetate and petroleum ether (BDH). A deuterated sample (D2-CBZ-Tyroet) was prepared by stirring the CBZ-Tyroet in D2 O (Fluorochem) for ca. 2 h, followed by freeze-drying. This process was repeated 3 times to ensure that all the exchangeable protons are replaced by deuterium. The samples were stored in a desiccator over di-phosphorus pentoxide at room temperature. The moisture content was 0.1 wt.% as measured by Karl–Fischer titration.  2.1.2 N-trifluoroacetyl-l -tyrosine ethyl ester (TFAc-Tyroet) TFAc-Tyroet was prepared by trifluoroacetylation of l -tyrosine ethyl ester (Sigma) with ethyl trifluoroacetate (Sigma), in the presence of tetramethyl guanidine (Sigma) [10] . A 20 g l -tyrosine ethyl ester was dissolved in 120 ml of absolute ethanol, 1.2 ml of tetramethyl guanidine followed by 12.5 ml of ethyl trifluoroacetate was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h in a fume cupboard. When the synthesis had been completed, 15 g Dowex 50X2-400 (Sigma) followed by 2 g Norit-A activated carbon (Sigma) was added. The mixture was stirred for a further 15 min. The mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth (Sigma) and followed by rotary evaporation. The TFAc-Tyroet was recrystallised from hot dichloromethane (BDH) and ethanol. The moisture content was 0.18 wt.% as measured by Karl–Fischer titration. The deuterated TFAc-Tyroet (D2-TFAc-Tyroet) was prepared in the same way as the D2-CBZ-Tyroet.  2.1.3 Acetyl-l -tyrosine ethyl ester (Ac-Tyroet) Ac-Tyroet was purchased from Sigma and used without any further treatment. The moisture content was 6.5 wt.% as measured by Karl–Fischer titration. The deuterated Ac-Tyroet (D2-Ac-Tyroet) was prepared in the same way as the D2-CBZ-Tyroet.   2.2 Solid state NMR measurements All the proton NMR relaxation measurements were carried out on a Bruker MSL-100 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 100.13 MHz over the temperature range between 110 and 350 K. Experiments were always started from the lowest temperature. T 2  was measured directly from the free induction decay (FID) following a 90° pulse. A 90° pulse length of 1 μs was used and the receiver deadtime following the pulse was 5 μs. The proton second moment was calculated from the FID assuming Gaussian line shapes [11] . The spin-lattice relaxation time (T 1 ) was measured via the inversion recovery (180x  °-τ -90x  °-detect) method [12] . The signal intensity at the beginning of each FID was recorded, a total of 48 data points were collected. In order to ensure that the spread of τ  values was sufficient to test for the existence of multi-exponential relaxation, the values of τ  were chosen according to τ =A ×10(n −1)/12 , where A  is a constant varying between 1–4 ms, depending on the estimate of T 1 , and n  is the number of data points. The spin-lattice relaxation times in the rotating frame, T 1ρ , were determined by spin-locking the magnetization in the rotating frame for a suitable period and monitoring the intensity of the resulting FID (90°-spin-lock-acquire) [13] . The spin-locking field strength were 40 kHz equivalent to a 90° pulse length of 6.25 μs. The spin-locking time varied from 400 μs to 51.2 ms. Single point sampling was used, 10 μs after spin-locking pulse. Dependent on the length of the T 1ρ , 48–128 data points were collected for each experiment. Co-added were 2–4 scans to improve the signal to noise ratio in both T 1  and T 1ρ  measurements. All data were analyzed using TableCurve (Jandel Scientific) which is a simultaneous multiple non-linear curve-fitting program and uses the Levenburg–Marquardt algorithm to minimize the sum of squares of the deviations between a calculated summation curve and the observed data points [14] .   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Pure tyrosine derivatives 3.1.1 Second moment The transverse relaxation processes of the three tyrosine derivatives can be fitted by a single Gaussian process. Fig. 2   shows the temperature dependence of the second moments for the three tyrosine derivatives. Generally, the second moments (M 2 ) reflect the strength of static dipolar interactions in the system. The general decrease in second moment with increasing temperature is probably due to lattice expansion rather than motional averaging since no clear transition is observed. The lower average value of second moment observed for TFAc-Tyroet compared to Ac-Tyroet is due to the lower density of protons in the sample. The lowest second moments are shown by CBZ-Tyroet, these may be due to the bulky benzene ring substituent causing poor crystal packing and reducing the intermolecular contribution to the second moment.  3.1.2 Spin-lattice relaxation in the laboratory frame The T 1 s of tyrosine derivatives were measured over the temperature range 130–360 K. The relaxation time can be fitted to a single exponential in all cases. The variation of R 1  with temperature is shown in Fig. 3  . R 1  of Ac-Tyroet shows two well-resolved R 1  maxima at 170 and 320 K. This indicates that the spin-lattice relaxation is mainly driven by two independent motions, one of which is effective below 250 K and the other one is effective above that temperature. Previous studies on the proton relaxation of amino acid amides suggest that methyl groups and their reorientations are expected to be important in relaxing the system [6, 8] . The low-temperature relaxation rate maximum of Ac-Tyroet occurs at within about 30°C of temperature as in l -leucinamide (200 K) [6] . Therefore, the effective motion that occurs below 250 K is likely to be the methyl group rotation. To identify the relaxation process at high temperature, the spin-lattice relaxation times of deuterated Ac-Tyroet were measured. The temperature dependence of relaxation is similar for both protonated and deuterated Ac-Tyroet and shown in Fig. 4  . This phenomenon is also observed in the T 1  of deuterated CBZ-Tyroet and TFAc-Tyroet. This implies that motions closely related to NH or OH or residual H2 O can be eliminated (see Section 2.1 ). The most likely motion left for relaxing the system is a benzene ring flip motion. Therefore the methyl group reorientation and benzene ring flip are assumed to be the major relaxation mechanisms for Ac-Tyroet. The data were fitted to an expression which was found to be very useful in the previous studies [6, 8] :(1) R1obs  =1 T1   =2 3  Pa  M2a   τa   1+ω2 τ2 a    +4τa   1+4ω2 τ2 a      +2 3  Pb  M2b   τb   1+ω2 τ2 b    +4τb   1+4ω2 τ2 b      .    This is an extension of the well-known relaxation expression of Kubo and Tomita [15] to two independent relaxation processes. ω /2π  is the frequency of measurement in Hertz; τ  is the correlation time of the molecular motion responsible for spin-lattice relaxation and M 2  is the second moment modulated by the corresponding motion. P a  and P b  are the relative populations of methyl protons and protons on the aromatic ring. They are 6/17 and 4/17 for Ac-Tyroet. It is also assumed that the temperature dependence of the correlation time is exponential, hence:(2) τ=τ0 exp  Ea   RT    .    Fig. 3  shows the good agreement between the calculated curve and experimental data for Ac-Tyroet. The optimized motional parameters of M 2 , τ 0  and E a  are summarised in Table 1  . The activation energy E a , corresponding to the low temperature motion, is 11.8 kJ/mol which is in good agreement with that found for methyl groups in l -leucinamide (10.9 kJ/mol) [6] . However, the second moment obtained is about 1.0×108  s−2  which is smaller than that from l -leucinamide (2.7×108  s−2 ). Examination of the chemical formula of Ac-Tyroet shows two methyl groups; one of which is bonded to a carbonyl carbon and the other one is next to a CH2  group. The rotations of the two methyl groups are expected to behave differently; the one bonded to a carbonyl carbon has a larger distance between methyl group and other protons. The behaviour of this methyl group is expected to be similar to those in methionine methyl d -α-galacturonic acid methyl ester [16] or methylpyranisides [17, 18] . This type of methyl group is less hindered, with a estimated activation energy of 6 kJ/mol and pre-exponential term of 2×10−13  s [16] . At 100 MHz, this type of methyl group has a relaxation maximum at about 80 K. The maximum observed at 170 K is therefore likely to be due to the motion of the more hindered group, CH2 –CH3 . In this case, the value of P a  in Eq. (1) should be 3/17 instead of 6/17, and M 2a  should be 2.0×108  s−2  which is much more consistent with other data. The second motion controlling the relaxation at high temperature (maximum at 320 K) was assumed to be a benzene ring flip. The second moment obtained from the curve fitting (2.7×107  s−2 ) is an order of magnitude smaller than that from the methyl group rotation, but is in broad agreement with that found in phenylalanine (M 2 :1.3×107  s−2 ) [19] . The maximum of relaxation rate occurs at 255 K for benzene ring flipping motion in phenylalanine [19] . In Ac-Tyroet, there is a hydroxyl group on the end of benzene ring, which is hydrogen-bonded to a amide group in a neighbouring molecule [20] and thus, restricting the motion of the ring. Since the rotation is more restricted, the rate maximum is likely to occur at a higher temperature. Fig. 3  also shows the temperature dependence of spin-lattice relaxation rate of CBZ-Tyroet. Following the results obtained in Ac-Tyroet, the rotational motion of the methyl group as the origin of spin-lattice relaxation in the laboratory frame at low temperature is also assumed. The data suggest that the relaxation at high temperature is relatively efficient (Fig. 3  insert), indicating a second effective motion occurring above 220 K, although no obvious relaxation rate maximum was seen. The second motion is also assumed to be the benzene ring flipping. The observed temperature dependence of R 1  was therefore fitted to Eqs. (1) and (2) with a P a  value of 3/21 and a P b  value of 9/21. Good agreement between the fitted curve and experimental data was obtained. Examination of the activation energy and pre-exponential term of methyl group rotation shows good agreement between CBZ-Tyroet and Ac-Tyroet (Table 1 ). However, the second moment obtained from assuming both methyl groups were active in Ac-Tyroet is about half of that from CBZ-Tyroet. This further suggests that the methyl group bonded to the carbonyl carbon in Ac-Tyroet is less hindered and does not have contribution to the relaxation at 170 K. Effectively, the system is relaxed by only one methyl group. In contrast to Ac-Tyroet where there is an R 1  maximum at 320 K, there are no obvious high temperature R 1  maxima in CBZ-Tyroet. Inspection of the chemical structure of the two molecules shows the presence of two benzene rings in CBZ-Tyroet, one of which is restricted by a hydroxyl group and the other one is not. The relatively free benzene ring motion is expected to relax the system efficiently at the temperature below 320 K. It is very likely that the relaxation mechanism occurring at higher temperature comprises two ring flip motions having different activation energies, the non-hydrogen-bonded benzene ring flipping at lower temperature. The presence of unrestricted benzene ring motion is manifest in the differences in proton T 1  value of CBZ-Tyroet (1.75 s) and Ac-Tyroet (3.56 s) at 250 K. However, the fitting procedure was unable to discriminate two motions and only one motion was assumed in the fit. T 1 s of TFAc-Tyroet were measured over the temperature range of 150–360 K. The variation of the spin-lattice relaxation rate with temperature is shown in Fig. 3 . In contrast to the Ac-Tyroet and CBZ-Tyroet, it shows only one maximum at around 170 K. This indicates the presence of a motion whose correlation time is about 10−9  s at 170 K. Following the previous study, the motion occurring at 170 K is likely to be the methyl group rotation. The observed R 1  is therefore fitted to the Eqs. (1) and (2) assuming that only methyl rotation is present. In this case, P a  in the Eq. (1) is 3/14 for the TFAc-Tyroet. Good agreement was found between the experimental data and the fitted curve. The calculated relaxation parameters for methyl group reorientation are summarised in Table 1 . The calculated relaxation parameters for methyl group rotation in TFAc-Tyroet are in good agreement with those of CBZ-Tyroet and Ac-Tyroet, confirming the assumption made as to the origin of the relaxation. However, the flipping motion of benzene ring in the TFAc-Tyroet is not observed in the temperature range studied, indicating that the motion is significantly hindered. The hindered motion is presumably due to the presence of the perfluorinated group. This lack of motion may have a role in the failure of this compound to form mixtures with amino acid amides.  3.1.3 Spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame T 1ρ  of protonated and deuterated Ac-Tyroet were measured at spin-locking field of 40 kHz in the temperature range 130–290 K, single-exponential T 1ρ  relaxation was observed. The dependence of R 1ρ  on temperature shown in Fig. 5   clearly illustrates that the system is mainly relaxed by two motions, one motion is effective below 240 K and the other one is effective above it. Furthermore, the curves for Ac-Tyroet and D2-Ac-Tyroet are similar at temperatures below 240 K, however, the higher temperature motion is affected by replacing exchangeable protons with deuterium. The data can be fitted to equations similar to those used in the T 1  analysis [21] :(3) R1ρ  =1 T1ρ    =Pa  M2a   τa   1+4ω2 τ2 a      +Pb  M2b   τb   1+4ω2 τ2 b      .   This equation is generally valid when τ a,b <T 2  and B 1 ≫B L [22] ; B 1  is the spin-locking field and B L , the local dipolar field. In the experiments, B 1  of 40 kHz was used and the averaged local dipolar field for Ac-Tyroet was 52 kHz, thus, B 1 <B L  which does not meet the requirement. Therefore, account must be taken for the effects of the local dipolar field. McCall and Douglass [23] have suggested using an equation of the form ω 2 =ω 1 2 +ω L 2 , where ω L /2π  is the local dipolar field which equals to square root of one third of second moment. From the T 1  of Ac-Tyroet, the effect of benzene ring motion was detected at 320 K, it is reasonable to assume that the motion below 240 K is benzene ring motion since the measurement of spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame has the effect of shifting the relaxation maxima into a lower temperature range. Therefore, P a  in Eq. (3) is 4/17 for Ac-Tyroet and 4/15 for D2-Ac-Tyroet. Since the second motion is difficult to identify positively, a P b  value of 13/17 for Ac-Tyroet and 11/15 for D2-Ac-Tyroet is assumed for the curve fitting. Fig. 5  shows the quality of the fitting. The results of the fitting are summarised in Table 1 . The values of M 2 , E a  and τ 0  are the same within experimental error for both protonated and deuterated samples in the temperature range below 240 K, indicating that deuteration has little effect on this motion. Supposing that the benzene ring flip is responsible for the T 1ρ  relaxation in this temperature range, therefore, the temperature dependence of R 1ρ  curve can be predicted from the relaxation parameters (within the error range) of benzene flipping motion obtained from T 1 . Fig. 5  shows the predicted curve. Clearly, the fitted curve does not agree very well with the predicted one; the fitted curve is wider than the predicted one. This may arise because the fitting of the T 1  data is rather poor, the peak is rather weak and is at the end of the temperature range. The pre-exponential factor found for the T 1  data is also very small. This suggests that the T 1ρ  data are more reliable. In contrast to the motion at lower temperature, the higher temperature motion is affected by replacing exchangeable protons with deuterium. Fig. 5  shows that deuterated sample is relaxed more efficiently in this temperature region. This must be due to the decrease in the number of protons to be relaxed by the motion [6, 15] . The motion that becomes apparent may be a motion involving a large part of the molecule. However, its origin is not certain so the motion will be referred to simply as the third motion. T 1ρ  of solid CBZ-Tyroet was measured over the temperature range 150–340 K and the dependence of R 1ρ  on temperature is shown in Fig. 6  . Relaxation of CBZ-Tyroet (Fig. 6 ) is similar to that of Ac-Tyroet (Fig. 5 ). One motion occurs below 270 K and the other one is effective at higher temperature. As with Ac-Tyroet, benzene ring flipping and the third mode of motion are assumed to account for the R 1ρ  of CBZ-Tyroet. The data are therefore fitted to Eq. (3) with a P a  value of 9/21 and a P b  of 12/21 for CBZ-Tyroet. The local dipolar field, ω L , (44 kHz) has also been taken into account. A fit of Eq. (3) to the temperature dependence of R 1ρ  of CBZ-Tyroet gives a pre-exponential factor of 7.0×10−10  for the motion effective below 270 K. This value is too high for the motion at low temperature. Usually, this is indicative of a distribution of correlation time [24, 25] . From the discussion of T 1  of CBZ-Tyroet, two benzene rings are present in the CBZ-Tyroet. Therefore, the relaxation below 270 K can be treated simply as the sum of two individual motions corresponding to restricted and unrestricted benzene ring flipping motions and thus, the R 1ρ  below 290 K may be written as:(4) R1ρ  =1 T1ρ    =Pa  M2a    τa   1+4ω2 τ2 a      + τb   1+4ω2 τ2 b           where τ a  and τ b  correspond to correlation times of the unrestricted and restricted benzene ring flipping motions. The fitted results are listed in Table 1 . Fig. 6  shows the good agreement between the fitted curve and the experimental data. The calculated activation energy and the pre-exponential term for the restricted benzene ring motion in CBZ-Tyroet is in good agreement with those in Ac-Tyroet although large uncertainties occurred in the curve fitting (Table 1 ). The activation energy obtained for the unrestricted motion is lower than that of restricted one, which is expected. The third motion appearing at higher temperatures is affected by deuterium replacement of exchangeable proton, which is similar to the observation made for Ac-Tyroet. However, since such a small part of the curve was observable no reliable fitted data could be obtained. The variation of R 1ρ  of TFAc-Tyroet and D2-TFAc-Tyroet with temperature is shown in Fig. 7  . The proton spin-lattice relaxation in the rotating frame of both protonated and deuterated samples is increasingly efficient below 240 K and no relaxation rate maximum was seen. This is in contrast to the results from Ac-Tyroet and CBZ-Tyroet where benzene ring motion was observed at 200 K. In the T 1  of TFAc-Tyroet analysis, methyl group reorientation was found to be the only relaxation mechanism. It is expected that it is also responsible for T 1ρ  relaxation at very low temperature. The temperature at which the maximum occurs is predicted to be around 92 K using the relaxation parameters for methyl group rotation found in the T 1  analysis. To confirm this, T 1ρ  of TFAc-Tyroet was measured between 110 to 140 K and it was found that the relaxation becomes more efficient as the temperature is decreased (see the insert Fig. 7 ). Therefore, the only relaxation mechanism for the T 1ρ  of TFAc-Tyroet can be reasonably assigned to methyl group rotation. This is consistent with the observation made in the T 1  analysis and suggests that the crystal structure results in a more rigid molecule than in the other compounds. This may be the cause of the failure to form a supercooled liquid mixture with l -leucinamide.   3.2 Mixtures of l -leucinamide/tyrosine derivatives l -leucinamide can spontaneously form supercooled liquid mixtures with CBZ-Tyroet and Ac-Tyroet. However, the melts of l -leuNH/TFAc-Tyroet do not supercool but rather crystallise into separated phases. The mixtures containing 1:1 l -leucinamide/tyrosine derivatives were studied by the temperature dependence of proton spin-lattice relaxation time in the laboratory frame. For the supercooled liquid mixture of l -leuNH/CBZ-Tyroet, a single exponential T 1  relaxation was found in the temperature range below 330 K, above that temperature, a slightly double exponential recovery of magnetization was detected. For the supercooled liquid mixture of l -leuNH/Ac-Tyroet, a slightly double exponential recovery of magnetization was detected above 345 K. The behaviour of spin-lattice relaxation of a two-component system depends on the spin diffusion rate between the components. When the spin diffusion rate is faster than the rate at which spin energy flows from the spin to lattice, averaging of the spatial inhomogeneities of the spin-lattice relaxation occurs and results in an observed single relaxation time. The spin diffusion rate is dependent on the strength of homonuclear dipolar interactions which, in turn, depends on both the distance between nuclei and molecular mobilities. At below 300 K, the transverse relaxation of the mixture comprises a Gaussian and an exponential process, above 300 K it is exponential. A single exponential spin-lattice relaxation is observed below 300 K. This is due to the strong static dipolar interactions, which exist in this temperature regime. When the temperature is above 330 K, the dipolar interactions are weakened as the result of molecular motion, consequently, the spin diffusion rate is slow, resulting in non-exponential recovery of T 1 . However, in the temperature range between 300 to 330 K, the single exponential T 1  relaxation observed in the mixture of LeuNH/CBZ-Tyroet is not the result of strong static interactions since the transverse relaxation of the mixture LeuNH/CBZ-Tyroet is an exponential process. The single exponential T 1  observed in this case may be due to the strong intra- and intermolecular interactions resulting from the fact that molecules in the mixtures are in close contact to each other. The spin-lattice relaxation behaviour of both the mixtures was treated as a single exponential process in the temperature range 150–360 K since only a few data show the double-exponential behaviour, and fitting our data to a single exponential function does not affect the analysis drastically. Fig. 8  Fig. 9   show the spin-lattice relaxation rates of the mixtures LeuNH/Ac-Tyroet and LeuNH/CBZ-Tyroet plotted against temperature. Clearly, two independent dominant relaxation mechanisms were detected, one of which is effective below 250 K and the other one is effective above that temperature. The methyl group rotation is expected to be responsible for the relaxation at low temperature [6] . To clarify the high temperature relaxation mechanism, the spin-lattice relaxation times of a deuterated supercooled liquid mixture of l -leuND/D2-CBZ-Tyroet (Fig. 9 ) were measured in the temperature range 140–360 K and plotted against temperature. Relatively efficient relaxation was still found at high temperature. This suggests that the spin-lattice relaxation at high temperature is not only due to the motions of NH2  or OH, but also some other contributions. Inspection of the spin-lattice relaxation times of the pure CBZ-Tyroet and Ac-Tyroet shows that the benzene ring flipping motion is expected in this temperature range. However, the strength of the relaxation in the mixtures is much larger than that could be generated by the benzene ring flipping, since this is a weaker relaxation source than the methyl group rotation (Fig. 4 ). The system is likely, in this case, to be relaxed by the molecular tumbling motion since considerable line narrowing was observed in the FID in this temperature range. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that rapid molecule tumbling is the major relaxation mechanism for the spin-lattice relaxation of the system at high temperature. The experimental data were then fitted in Eq. (1) . P a  is the methyl group proton population, the value is 9/35 for the mixture of l -leuNH/CBZ-Tyroet and 9/31 for l -leuNH/Ac-Tyroet. P b  is set to unity since all the protons in the mixture contribute to the relaxation. Figs. 8 and 9  show the good agreement between the fitted curves and experimental data. The results are given in Table 2  . The second moment calculated for methyl group rotation is in the same order of magnitude as those in pure solids. However, the activation energy of the methyl group rotation in the mixture is smaller than those found for the pure solids. The molecules in supercooled liquid mixtures are loosely packed. As a consequence, rotation of methyl group might be less hindered compared to the corresponding crystal state. This might be the reason for the low activation energy observed. The relaxation rates of these mixtures at low temperature can be predicted from the corresponding crystals assuming that methyl group rotation is the relaxation mechanism. The predictions shown in Figs. 8 and 9  differ from the experimental values. This indicates the effects of molecular arrangement on the methyl group rotation. In contrast to the mixtures of l -leuNH/CBZ-Tyroet and l -leuNH/Ac-Tyroet, the mixture of l -leuNH/TFAc-Tyroet does not form a supercooled liquid. The T 1  of a mixture of l -leuNH/TFAc-Tyroet (1:1) were measured over the temperature range 150–360 K. Unlike the liquid mixtures, double exponential relaxation times were found for the temperature range studied. The short T 1  component varied between 0.08 to 0.69 s and the long T 1  component varied between 0.3 to 10 s. The double exponential behaviour of spin-lattice relaxation indicates that the mixture of l -leuNH/TFAc-Tyroet is a two phase system and that the spin diffusion between the two components is slow on the time scale of T 1 . The temperature dependence of relaxation rate of both components is shown in Fig. 10  . A comparison of both the relaxation times with the pure components of l -leuNH and TFAc-Tyroet shows that the long relaxation component coincides well with the R 1  of TFAc-Tyroet and that the short component is close to the R 1  of l -leuNH. From this observation, it can be inferred that the mixture of l -leuNH/TFAc-Tyroet behaves as if both components were in their pure states. This suggestion is confirmed by the proportion of the two components. At temperatures above 260 K, the proportion of short T 1  component comprises about 50%. This agrees very well with the proton population of l -leuNH. The short T 1  represents the population of l -leuNH protons, and the long T 1  represents that of the TFAc-Tyroet protons. This is in contrast to the liquid mixtures where the mixtures act differently from their pure states. At low temperature (below 210 K) there is significant deviation of the LeuNH data in the mixture from the pure state, both apparent population and relaxation rate deviate. This may be due to long range spin diffusion effects at this temperature. The ability to form supercooled liquid mixture can be related to the molecular dynamics of the pure substrates. A comparison of the dynamics of these tyrosine derivatives shows that the benzene ring flipping motion and the third motion are absent in the fluorine substituted compound. The reason remains unclear. The preliminary X-ray data did not show strong interactions between the fluorine atoms and the benzene ring, which agrees with the conclusions from UV and Raman spectra. The absence of benzene ring flipping and the third motion in the fluorinated compound implies that the level of order in this crystal is higher than those in the other compounds studied. On crystallisation there will be only one molecular conformation (with respect to the benzene ring) that is possible. Formation of a crystal is therefore only a matter of the whole molecule assuming the correct orientation with respect to its neighbours and packing closely. In the case of Ac-Tyroet there is variability in the conformation with respect to the benzene ring in molecules in the crystal. This will mean that, in effect, the benzene rings will occupy a greater volume than if they were static (in the case of TFAc-Tyroet) and therefore, the intermolecular distances will be greater than in the fluorinated analogue. This in turn implies a weaker intermolecular interactions. This suggestion is supported by the fact that fluorine substitution increases the melting point of the crystal from about 78°C to 175°C. The presence of highly mobile, non-rigid molecules are also likely to inhibit crystal formation. In the presence of another solute, this is likely to lead to the formation of supercooling systems since only weak interactions in solute will be enough to prevent crystallisation. Similar observations of the effects of fluorination have been made by Dow et al. [26] . It was found that fluorine-substituted lipids form solids on cooling in 30–60 min, whereas unsubstituted lipids require a cooling period of hours or days. It was also shown that less mobility was associated with fluorine-substituted lipids [26] .   4 Conclusions The proton relaxation behaviour of three tyrosine derivatives: Ac-Tyroet, CBZ-Tyroet, TFAc-Tyroet and their mixtures with l -leucinamide was studied. The extension of the well-known relaxation expression of Kubo and Tomita to several independent relaxation processes was used to identify the relaxation mechanisms and estimate the relaxation parameters. It was found that methyl group rotation is important for relaxing the system at low temperature in both the pure state and mixtures. In addition, both benzene ring flipping and a third motion were found to be the relaxation mechanisms for Ac-Tyroet and CBZ-Tyroet, however, these motions are absent in TFAc-Tyroet. In the mixtures, molecular tumbling motion is responsible for relaxing the supercooled liquids l -leuNH/CBZ-Tyroet and l -leuNH/Ac-Tyroet. However, this motion is absent in the mixture l -leuNH/TFAc-Tyroet. The absence of benzene ring flipping motion and the third motion in the pure tyrosine derivatives may affect its ability to form a supercooled liquid with l -leucinamide.
