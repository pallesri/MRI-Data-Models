 Dinucleoside polyphosphates (Npn N) are molecules of crescent interest in metabolic regulation and cell signaling [1–3] . Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4 A) is present at (sub)micromolar concentration in all the prokaryotic and eukaryotic tissues examined [4] . The occurrence of Ap4 A, Ap5 A and Ap6 A has been reported in the dense granules of human blood platelets [5–7] , in some rat brain synaptic terminals [8, 9]  and in chromaffin granules of bovine adrenal medullary gland [10–13] . The concentration of ATP in both the total adrenal medullary tissue and in chromaffin granules is three orders of magnitude higher than that of Ap4 A [13] . Upon liberation from the adrenal medulla, after an appropriate stimulus, the rate of hydrolysis of the secreted ATP is so high that less than 1% remains as ATP, whereas the secreted Ap4 A was apparently degraded at a much slower rate [12, 13] . Probably both ATP and Ap4 A are hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterases [14–16]  (and phosphatases and nucleotidases for ATP) located in the outer aspect of cell plasma membranes and the ATP itself could be a competitive inhibitor of the degradation of Ap4 A in the extracellular fluid [12] . For that reason, the use of Ap4 A monitoring as a reliable index of true secretion from chromaffin granules was suggested [12] . The secreted ATP, the diadenosine polyphosphates, and their products of hydrolysis may interact with not yet well defined purine receptors, P2X , P2Y , P2D , P4  and P1  [17–20] , and modulate a variety of processes such as vascular tone [6, 21–23] , cell proliferation [24, 25] , cardiac function [26] , neurotransmission [17, 27] , platelet aggregation [28] , glucose metabolism [29, 30] , cellular pH [31]  and neutrophil function [32] . The potential implication of dinucleoside polyphosphates in the pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis has been suggested [7, 23]  and their longer stability in vivo in relation to ATP have inspired basic research on the potential clinical utility of some chemical analogues [33] . Of special interest in relation to this paper is the strong vasoconstrictor effect reported for diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6 A) and diadenosine pentaphosphate (Ap5 A) in the isolated perfused rat kidney at concentrations as low as 1 nM [6] . The synthesis of both Ap6 A and Ap5 A catalyzed by firefly luciferase has been previously reported [34] . However, this enzyme apparently only exists in the lanterns of fireflies and not in mammals. The synthesis of a variety of mono- and dinucleoside polyphosphates, including adenosine tetraphosphate (p4 A), adenosine pentaphosphate (p5 A), Ap4 A, Ap5 A, and various heterodinucleoside tetraphosphates (Ap4 N) by acyl-CoA synthetase from Pseudomonas fragi  has been recently reported [35] . The objet of this report is to present evidence that this enzyme also catalyzes the synthesis of the strong vasoactive diadenosine hexaphosphate (Ap6 A).  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials The commercial preparation of Pseudomonas fragi  acyl-CoA synthetase was from Boehringer Mannheim (catalogue no. 1002406; lot: 94110725). The lyophilyzed powders were dissolved (3.62 mg/mL) in 25 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Dithiothreitol, ammonium tetrapolyphosphate (P4 ) and nucleotides were from Sigma. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V; fatty acids free), phosphodiesterase from Crotalus durissus  (catalogue no. 108260), alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from calf intestine (catalogue no. 108138) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) from yeast (catalogue no. 108987) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Asymmetrical dinucleoside tetraphosphatase was purified from rat liver as described by Sillero et al. [36] . Pyrophosphatase was desalted by ultrafiltration using microconcentrators with exclusion limit membranes of 30 kDa (from Vivascience) [35] . HPLC chromatographs were from Hewlett Packard or from Waters. The Hypersil ODS and Mono Q columns were from Hewlett Packard and Pharmacia, respectively.  2.2 Methods All the incubations were performed at 30 °C.  2.3 Synthesis of Ap6 A using ATP and P4  as substrates of acyl-CoA synthetase The reaction mixture (0.4 mL) contained 50 mM MES-KOH (pH 5.5), 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2 , 4.4 mM ATP, 5 mM P4 , acyl-CoA synthetase from Pseudomonas fragi  (0.325 mg protein/mL) and desalted pyrophosphatase (1.2%; v/v). 20 μL aliquots were withdrawn at various times of incubation at 30 °C, diluted with 180 μL of water, kept at 100 °C for 90 s, chilled, filtered and analyzed by HPLC using an Hypersil ODS column (100 mm × 2.1 mm). Elutions were performed at a constant flow rate (0.5 mL /min) with a 20-min linear gradient (5–30 mM) of sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) in 20 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide/20% methanol (buffer A), followed by a 10-min linear gradient (30–100 mM) of sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) in buffer A.  2.4 Purification of the synthesized Ap6 A Reaction mixtures were set up as described above. After incubation for 40 h they were heated at 100 °C for 90 s, centrifuged, the supernatant brought to pH 7.8 with HEPES-KOH mM and treated with 25 μg of protein/mL alkaline phosphatase during 2 h. At the end of the incubation, the mixtures were heated at 100 °C for 90 s, centrifuged and all the supernatant injected into a Mono Q column (0.5 cm × 5 cm) (Pharmacia) and eluted (HPLC) with 40 min linear NH4 HCO3  gradient (0.5–0.7 M). The fractions containing the presumed Ap6 A were pooled, an aliquot was rechromatographed in the same conditions to establish the purity of the pool, and the rest concentrated by lyophilization.  2.5 Characterization of the synthesized Ap6 A. Phosphodiesterase treatment The reaction mixture (0.17 mL) contained 15 μM of purified Ap6 A, 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2) and commercial phosphodiesterase of Crotalus durissus  (2.4 μg of protein/mL). Asymmetrical dinucleoside tetraphosphatase treatment: the reaction mixture (0.28 mL) contained 12 μM of purified Ap6 A, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2  and rat liver asymmetrical dinucleoside tetraphosphatase (0.04 mU/mL). Aliquots were taken at various times of incubation and analyzed by HPLC using an Hypersil ODS column (100 mm × 4.6 mm) and eluting with 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) in 20 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide/20% methanol. The products have been identified by co-elution with appropriate standards.   3 Results and discussion Although in our view the mechanism of reaction of acyl-CoA synthetase is not yet completely clarified, here it is assumed that the synthesis of Ap4 N takes place through reactions (1) and (2), with the trace amounts of fatty acid needed being supplied by the proper enzyme preparation or by other component of the reaction mixture (see reference [35] ). E + RCOOH + ATP → E.RCO-AMP + Ppi (1) E.RCO-AMP + NTP → E + RCOOH + Ap4 N (2) ATP is the preferred substrate for reaction (1) [35] . The second step is rather unspecific and all the nucleoside triphosphates tested were acceptors of the AMP moiety of the intermediate complex giving rise to a variety of heterodinucleoside polyphosphates (Ap4 N) [35] . Tri- and tetrapolyphosphates (P3  and P4 ) are also acceptor substrates for the synthesis of p4 A and p5 A, respectively [35] . The synthesis of Ap6 A could be approached using ATP and p5 A as donor and acceptor of AMP, respectively. Unfortunately, p5 A is not commercially available. However, as the enzyme synthesizes p5 A from ATP and P4  [35] , a reaction mixture containing ATP and P4  was set up as described in Materials and methods  and analyzed by HPLC after different periods of incubation. As expected, a compound corresponding to p5 A ( figure 1  , peak 5) was firstly synthesized increasing in the first 24 h of reaction and decreasing thereafter. In the first 12 h of incubation the average rate of synthesis of p5 A was 4.2 mU/mg of protein; its concentration was 1.0 mM and 1.3 mM at time 12 h and 24 h, respectively. A new peak (peak d6), corresponding presumably to Ap6 A, appeared along the time of incubation. Between time 12 h and 24 h of incubation the average rate of synthesis of Ap6 A was 0.40 mU/mg of protein and its concentration increased from 51 μM to 144 μM during that time. Synthesis of Ap4 A (peak d4) was also observed due to the dual role of ATP as donor and acceptor of adenylate (figure 1) . p4 A (peak 4) and Ap5 A (d5) were also synthesized due to the P3  present as product of hydrolysis or contaminating the P4  preparations (figure 1) . In a control without enzyme only a partial hydrolysis of ATP into ADP (peak 2) and AMP (peak 1) was observed (results not shown). The synthesized Ap6 A was characterized by its UV spectrum, co-elution with commercial Ap6 A and by treatment with hydrolytic enzymes. For that, reaction mixtures similar to the one reported above were treated with alkaline phosphatase and, by chromatography on a Mono Q column (see Materials and methods ), peaks corresponding to adenosine, Ap4 A, Ap5 A and Ap6 A were separated (not shown). Fractions containing the presumed Ap6 A were joined and the purity of the pool checked as described in Materials and methods . The remaining of the pool was frozen, dried in vacuum, and a volume of 0.23 mL of 146 μM Ap6 A was obtained. The purified Ap6 A was treated with commercial phosphodiesterase from Crotalus durissus  or with asymmetrical dinucleoside tetraphosphatase (see Materials and methods ). Upon phosphodiesterase treatment formation of AMP and p5 A was firstly observed and upon asymmetrical dinucleoside tetraphosphatase treatment the only product of hydrolysis was ATP (figure 2) .  Here we have shown that acyl-CoA synthetase from Pseudomonas fragi  catalyzes, in vitro, the synthesis of Ap6 A, Ap5 A and Ap4 A. It has been hypothesized that the enzymes (mainly synthetases and some transferases) able to form an adenylyl intermediate with simultaneous liberation of PPi in the course of the enzyme mechanism would be able to synthesize Ap4 N [37] . Probably, these enzymes could also be able to catalyze, at least in vitro, the synthesis of p4 A, p5 A, Ap5 A and Ap6 A. It is known since 1966 that certain aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the synthesis of Ap4 A using ATP as adenylyl donor and acceptor [38] ; it has also been reported that in the presence of ATP and P3  lysil-tRNA synthetase from E. coli  can catalyze the synthesis of p4 A [39] . The synthesis of p4 A or p5 A from ATP and P3  or P4 , respectively, has been shown to be catalyzed by yeast acetyl-CoA synthetase [40]  and firefly luciferase [34] . The possibility that, in vivo, the synthesis of Ap5 A and Ap6 A takes place through the mechanism shown to be possible in vitro (this work) is, at present, somewhat speculative and implies the simultaneous presence of those enzymes, the adequate adenylyl donor ATP and an adequate adenylyl acceptor (p4 A and p5 A or P3  and P4 ) in a particular microenvironment of the cell. Actually, p4 A is present in horse and rabbit muscle [41]  and in adrenal medullary gland [13] . The occurrence of polyphosphates in mammalian tissues has also been reported [42, 43] . The in vivo relative contributions to the synthesis of Ap6 A of the different enzymes able to catalyze in vitro the synthesis dinucleoside polyphosphates is beyond the objectives of this paper. From data presented above and in a previous paper [35]  it can be inferred that the activity of synthesis of Ap6 A catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase from Pseudomonas fragi  would be three to four orders of magnitude lower than the activity of synthesis of palmitoyl-CoA. Similar orders of magnitude for the synthesis of Ap4 A compared to that of aminoacyl-tRNA has also been observed in the cases of valyl and methionyl-tRNA synthetases from E. coli  and, however, this low activity did not precluded the induction of in vivo increase concentration of Ap4 N by over expression of these enzymes [44] . Acyl-CoA synthetases have been described in the membranes of rat liver peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria [45–47] . The association of acyl-CoA synthetases with membranous material supports the speculation that these enzymes could be involved in the synthesis of diadenosine polyphosphates in chromaffin granules and in synaptic terminals of the nervous system.
