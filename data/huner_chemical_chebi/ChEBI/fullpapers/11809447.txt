 Salvia  is an important genus consisting of ca 900 species in the family Lamiaceae (formerly Labiatae) and some species of Salvia  have been cultivated worldwide for use in folk medicines and for culinary purposes. The dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza  (Chinese Danshen), for example, has been used extensively for the treatment of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hepatitis, hepatocirrhosis, chronic renal failure, dysmenorrhea and neuroasthenic insomnia (Li, 1998 ). Studies on the chemical constituents of Salvia  have been mainly confined to the diterpenoids and the tanshinones (Chang et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 1990 ) and several reviews on these components have now been published (Prokopenko and Litvinenko, 1980; Kong, 1989; Tang and Eisenbrand, 1992; Al-Hazimi and Miana, 1994; Rodriguez-Hahn et al., 1995; Ulubelen and Topcu, 1998 ). However, in recent years much attention has been directed to the biologically active, water-soluble components in the dried root decoction used in traditional medicine (Zhang and Liu, 1996 ). These studies, particularly in China, have led to the isolation and identification of a host of caffeic acid derived metabolites (Li, 1998 ), many of which possess a variety of biological activities including antioxidant, antiplatelet, antitumor and antiviral activity (see Table 1  ). This review is written to take into account of the rapid development in the phytochemistry and therapeutical applications of species of Salvia .  2 Phenolic acids The polar phenolic acids constitute the major part of the water-soluble components of the Salvia  decoction. Most of the phenolic acids identified so far are those from the Chinese Danshen, S. miltiorrhiza , S. chinensis  and S. yunnanensis  and the compounds unique to Salvia  are consequently designated salvianolic acids A–K or yunnaneic acids A–H to reflect their origin (see Table 2  ). Apart from a few simple benzoic acids such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (Wang et al., 2000 ), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid or protocatechuic acid (Wu et al., 1999a ), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzoic acid or vanillic acid (Cuvelier et al., 1996 ) and 2,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid (Topcu et al., 1995 ), an ether linked dimer of hexyl 4-hydroxybenzoate or di(4-hexyloxycarbonylphenyl)ether (Ulubelen et al., 1995 ) and two coumarins 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (esculetin) (Ulubelen and Tuzlaci, 1990 ) and 7-methoxycoumarin (herniarin) (El-Missiry et al., 1994 ), the majority of the phenolic acids in Salvia  species are exclusively those of caffeic acid (1 ) derivatives, which are unique to Salvia  except for rosmarinic acid (2 ) and lithospermic acid (9 ) (see Fig. 1   for chemical structures). 2.1 Caffeic acid metabolites Caffeic acid plays a central role in the biochemistry of Lamiaceae and occurs predominantly in the dimer form as rosmarinic acid (Gerhardt and Schroeter, 1983 ). In the Salvia  species the caffeic acid is the building block of a variety of the plant metabolites from the more simple monomers to multiple condensation products to give rise to a variety of oligomers. The trimers and tetramers are more interesting from the therapeutic point of view as they have been shown to possess significant biological activities. 2.1.1 Caffeic acid monomers The monomers that are frequently present in Salvia  are represented by caffeic acid itself and 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)lactic acid (3 ) (Qian and Li, 1992 ). The latter compound, also known as danshensu (Chinese word to mean literally the element of Danshen) was first isolated from S. miltiorrhiza  (Yang and Zhang, 1981 ) and found to be a coronary vasodilator and to scavenge the free oxygen radicals generated during ischemia-reperfusion injury in the myocardium as effectively as superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Zhao et al., 1996 ). The amide of 3 , 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)lactamide (4 ), also found in S. miltiorrhiza , had been reported to possess radical scavenging activity greater than ascorbic acid (Kang et al., 1997 ). Other monomeric derivatives including ferulic acid (Cuvelier et al., 1996 ), isoferulic acid (Ai and Li, 1992 ) and two caffeic acid esters mono-feruloyl-R ,R -(+)-tartaric acid (6 ) (Qian et al., 1993 ) and chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid) (7 ) (Kokkalou and Kapetanidis, 1988 ) have also been described as Salvia  constituents. The identification of mono-feruloyl-R ,R -(+)-tartaric acid has been corroborated by chemical synthesis, along with its two S ,S -(-)- and R ,S -(meso )-isomers. Chlorogenic acid, despite being common and widespread in fruits, is surprisingly uncommon in Lamiaceae, which is generally dominated by rosmarinic acid (Gerhardt and Schroeter, 1983 ). Caffeic acids esterified with sugars are quite common in nature and those identified in Salvia  are discussed under Phenolic Glycosides  (see below).  2.1.2 Caffeic acid dimers Rosmarinic acid (2 ) is the most abundant caffeic acid dimer in Salvia  species (Ai and Li, 1988; Cuvelier et al., 1994; Lu and Foo, 1999 ) and has been reported to be the major phenolic compound responsible for the high antioxidant activity of Salvia  samples (Cuvelier et al., 1996 ). There have been many publications on rosmarinic acid dealing with its detection and quantitative estimation in various Salvia  preparations (Janicsak and Mathe, 1997; Yuan et al., 1998; Areias et al., 2000 ), its biochemical production in cell cultures (Morimoto et al., 1994 ) or chemical synthesis (Eicher et al., 1996 ) and its metabolism in rats (Nakazawa and Ohsawa, 1998 ). Other types of dimers identified in Salvia  include przewalskinic acid A (8 ) from the Tibetan sage S. przewalskii  (Lu et al., 1991 ), salvianolic acid G (11 ) (Ai and Li, 1991 ) and the stilbenoid salvianolic acid F or 2-(3,4-dihydroxystyryl)caffeic acid (12 ) (Ai and Li, 1996 ) both from S. miltiorrhiza . The dihydrobenzofuran compound przewalskinic acid A is apparently related to lithospermic acid (9 ) and salvianolic acid B or lithospermic acid B (10 ), whereas salvianolic acid G, with a dibenzooxepin skeleton, is the first of its kind found in Salvia . Salvianolic acid F, which has been synthesised by Dalla and Cotelle (1999) , is a decarboxylated caffeic acid dimer. In addition, Ulubelen and co-workers (1996)  have reported the existence of two isomeric caffeic acid ester dimers linked by ether bond, namely the dioctyl 3-O -3′-di-cis - and di-trans -isoferulate (14 , 15 ) in S. forskahlei .  2.1.3 Caffeic acid trimers Trimers derived from caffeic acid constitute the largest group of metabolites in Salvia.  They include compounds such as lithospermic acid (9 ) (Qian and Li, 1992 ), salvianolic acids H (16 ) (Zhang and Li, 1993 ), I (17 ) (Zhang and Li, 1994 ), J (18 ) (Ai et al., 1994 ) and K (19 ) (Tezuka et al., 1998; Lu and Foo, 1999 ), sagecoumarin (20 ) (Lu et al., 1999 ), three decarboxylated forms of salvianolic acids A (13 ) (Li et al., 1984 ), C (21 ) (Ai and Li, 1988 ) and isosalvianolic acid C (22 ) (Qian and Li, 1992 ) as well as yunnaneic acids C (24 ), D (25 ), E (26 ) and F (27 ) (Tanaka et al., 1996; 1997 ). These last mentioned are apparent Diels–Alder adducts of caffeic acids. Lithospermic acid and both its mono-and dimethyl esters were the active components that inhibited adenylate cyclase (Kohda et al., 1989 ). In addition, dimethyl lithospermate was also shown to be a stronger radical scavenger than ascorbic acid (Kang et al., 1997 ). The new member of the salvianolic acid series is salvianolic acid K and its presence has been detected by LC–MS in 10 Salvia  species (Kasimu et al., 1998 ).    Salvianolic acid A, the stilbenoid caffeic acid trimer has been shown to possess a strong oxygen free radical scavenging activity (Huang and Zhang, 1992; Li et al., 1995 ) which may be the basis for some of its biological activities (see Table 1 ). Salvianolic acid A is apparently not very stable and its reactivity has been demonstrated by its conversion to salvianolic acid C on a TLC plate that was impregnated with 2% of formic acid solution. This suggested that salvianolic acid C, a benzofuran compound, was likely a cyclization product of salvianolic acid A (Ai and Li, 1988 ). Isosalvianolic acid C, a second depside to salvianolic acid G with a dibenzooxepin skeleton, has been identified only in S. chinensis  along with salvianolic acid D (23 ) (Qian and Li, 1992 ), the latter could be considered as an abridged caffeic acid trimer that was first found in S. miltiorrhiza  (Ai and Li, 1992 ). Yunnaneic acids C and D both of which contain the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core structure appear to be the Diels–Alder adducts involving the double bond of the caffeic acid and the phenol ring or its quinone form in a rosmarinic acid moiety. Further oxidation of yunnaneic acid C resulted in the formation of yunnaneic acid E while the addition of an acetyl group to the bicyclo[2.2.2]octa-1,2-dione skeleton in yunnaneic acid C led to yunnaneic acid F.              2.1.4 Caffeic acid tetramers Caffeic acid tetramers are in effect dimerised rosmarinic acids as in salvianolic acids B (10 ) (Ai and Li, 1988 ), E (28 ) (Ai and Li, 1992 ) and L (32 ) (Lu and Foo, 2001b ), rabdosiin (29 ), yunnaneic acids G (30 ) and H (31 ) (Tanaka et al., 1997 ), and sagerinic acid (33 ) (Lu and Foo, 1999 ). Distribution of salvianolic acid E is more restricted and has been reported only in S. miltiorrhiza  while salvianolic acid B, which is also known as lithospermic acid B, is more common in Salvia  species and occurs mainly as potassium, ammonium or magnesium salts. These salts constitute largely the most important bioactive Salvia  components in sage (see Table 1 ). Three methyl esters of lithospermic acid B, namely the 9′- and 9‴-monomethyl lithospermate B and dimethyl lithospermate B, have been found recently in Tibetan sage together with other known polyphenolic compounds (Wu et al., 1999b ). In addition to the yunnaneic acids C to F mentioned above, Tanaka et al. (1997)  have also identified three oxidatively cyclized rosmarinic acid dimers with a 1,2-dihydronaphthalene core comprising of rabdosiin, yunnaneic acids G and H in S. yunnanesis.  Most recently, salvianolic acid L, an isomer of rabdosiin or yunnaneic acid G, has been found in S. officinalis . In addition, a more structurally interesting new type of [2+2]-rosmarinic acid dimer is sagerinic acid reported in S. officinalis , which contained a cyclobutane ring in the μ-truxinate form. Sagerinic acid is the first example of a natural [2+2]-dimers of caffeic acid esters.  2.1.5 Higher caffeic acid oligomers Yunnaneic acids A (34 ) and B (35 ) found in S. yunnanesis  (Tanaka et al., 1996 ) are the only known hexamers of caffeic acid. These two compounds could be formed by spiroacetal bonding between yunnaneic acid C (24 ) and yunnaneic acid D (25 ) or between two molecules of 24 . The presence of these Diels–Alder type adducts in S. yunnanesis  indicates the complexity in the biochemistry of plant metabolism.   2.2 Phenolic glycosides The phenolic glycosides are apparently not very common in Salvia  and rosmarinic acid 3′-glucoside1  1 Unless otherwise mentioned, common sugars glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, rhamnose, fructose and apiose denote β-d -glucopyranose, β-d -galactopyranose, β-d -xylopyranose, α-l -arabiopyranose, α-l -rhamnopyranose, β-d -fructofuranose and β-d -apiofuranose, respectively.   (salviaflaside) (36 ) and its methyl ester (Zhao et al., 1996a ) as well as the cis  and trans -p -coumaric acid 4-O -(2-O -apiosyl)glucosides (37 , 38 ) (Lu and Foo, 2000 ) are the only examples of the glycosylated phenolic acids. In contrast the phenolic acids esterified with sugars, in which the phenolic acids serve as acylating agents to give rise to acylated sugars, are more common. These acylated sugars include 6-O -feruloyl-α- and β-glucose (39 , 40 ) (Wang et al., 1998 ), 1-O -(2,3,4-trihydroxy-3-methyl)butyl-6-O -feruloylglucoside (41 ) (Wang et al., 2000 ), 6-O -caffeoyl-1-O -fructosyl-α-glucoside (42 ), 1-O -caffeoyl-6-O -apiosylglucoside (43 ), 1-O -p -hydroxybenzoyl-6-O -apiosylglucoside (44 ), all from S. officinalis  (Wang et al., 1999 ), and prionitisides A (45 ) and B (46 ) from S. prionitis . The structures of prionitisides A and B were elucidated as 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-glucosyloxycarbonyl-4,6-dihydroxybenzofuran and 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-rutinosyloxy carbonyl-4,6-dihydroxybenzofuran, respectively (Zhao et al., 1996b ). Several phenolic acetophenone glycosides have been also identified in S. officinalis  and these include 4-hydroxyacetophenone 4-O -glucoside (picein) (47 ), 4-hydroxyacetophenone 4-O -(6-O -apiosyl)glucoside (48 ), 4-hydroxyacetophenone 4-O -(2-O -(5-O -syringoylapiosyl)glucoside) (49 ) (Wang et al., 2000 ). Also present in S. officinalis  are glycosides of neolignans namely 1-hydroxypinoresinol 1-O -glucoside (50 ), isolariciresinol 3α-O -glucoside (51 ) and 2-(3-methoxy-4-glucosyloxyphenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (52) (Wang et al., 1998 ). In addition, two related isolariciresinol compounds feruloyl-secoisolariciresinol 12-methylmyristate (53 ) (Powell and Plattner, 1976 ) and secoisolariciresinol di(12-methylmyristate) (54 ) (Plattner and Powell, 1978 ) and a structurally related compound to 52  2-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(3-hydroxypropyl)-7-methoxybenzofuran-3-carbaldehyde (55 ) (Yang et al., 1991 ) have been reported in the seed of S. plebeia  and in the root of S. miltiorrhiza,  respectively. Compound 55  has also been produced synthetically (Kuo and Wu, 1996 ) and shown to be a novel adenosine A1 receptor ligand.   3 Flavonoids Flavonoids are widely distributed in species of Salvia  (Sagdullaeva and Khazanovich, 1972; Smirnova et al., 1974b; Adzet et al., 1987; Ulubelen and Tuzlaci, 1990 ), being mostly present as flavones, flavonols and their glycosides (see Tables 3 and 4   ). The 6-hydroxylated flavones have been reported to be of particularly taxonomic significance to this genus (Tomas-Barberan and Wollenweber, 1990 ). 3.1 Flavone and flavonol aglycones The majority of flavonoids are flavones of apigenin (5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavone) (56 ) and luteolin (5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone) (60 ) and their corresponding 6-hydroxylated derivatives. The methyl ethers of flavones are widely distributed in the leaves of Salvia  or in the exudate from aerial parts (Wollenweber, 1974; Wollenweber et al., 1992 ). The etherification of apigenin seemed to occur preferably on the phenolic 7-OH while the catechol B-ring of luteolin is etherified before the A-ring. Thus apigenin 7-methyl ether (genkwanin) (57 ) and 7,4′-dimethyl ether (59 ) are common (Wollenweber et al., 1992 ) while the 4′-methyl ether (acacetin) (58 ) has been found only in S. nicolsoniana  (Pereda-Miranda and Delgado, 1986 ) and S. yosgadensis  (Topcu et al., 1996 ). Likewise, luteolin 3′-methyl ether (chrysoeriol) (62 ) and 4′-methyl ether (diosmetin) (63 ) are more frequently encountered (Wollenweber et al., 1992; Topcu et al., 1995 ), followed by 7-methyl ether (61 ) and 7,3′,4′-trimethyl ether (66 ) (Ulubelen and Tuzlaci, 1990 ). Luteolin 7,4′-dimethyl ether (64 ) (Miski et al., 1983 ) and 3′,4′-dimethyl ether (65 ) (Pereda-Miranda and Delgado, 1986 ) have only been reported once before in S. palaestina  and S. nicolsoniana , respectively. The 6-hydroxyflavones are the flavonoids that characterise species of Salvia . They include a variety of 6-hydroxylated apigenin and luteolin derivatives, with 6-hydroxyapigenin-6,7-dimethyl ether (cirsimaritin) (69 ), 6,7,4′-trimethyl ether (salvigenin) (72 ), and 6-hydroxyluteolin 6-methyl ether (nepetin or eupafolin) (75 ), 6,7-dimethyl ether (cirsiliol) (77 ), 6,7,4′-trimethyl ether (eupatorin) (81 ) and 6,7,3′,4′-tetramethyl ether (83 ) being the most common (Tomas-Lorente et al., 1988; Wollenweber et al., 1992 ). 6-Hydroxyapigenin (scutellarein) itself (67 ) was only detected in sage extracts by HPLC (Cuvelier et al., 1996 ) and other 6-hydroxyapigenin methyl ethers including 6-methyl ether (hispidulin) (68 ), 6,4′-dimethyl ether (pectolinarigenin) (70 ), 7,4′-dimethyl ether (71 ) and 5,6,7,4′-tetramethyl ether (5-methoxysalvigenin) (73 ) were reported only occasionally, as were the 6-hydroxyluteolin 7-methyl ether (pedalitin) (76 ), 6,3′-dimethyl ether (jaceosidin) (78 ), 7,4′-dimethyl ether (nuchensin) (79 ), 6,7,3′-trimethyl ether (cirsilineol) (80 ) and 6,3′,4′-trimethyl ether (eupatilin) (82 ). Cirsimaritin was reported to have a high anti-microbial activity against several bacteria strains (Miski et al., 1983 ) while hispidulin possessed antihepatotoxic activity (Oshima et al., 1984 ). In a more recent report (Viola et al., 1998 ), the sedative-depressant property for cirsiliol was described. An unusual flavone which lacks the 5-OH group, namely 6,7,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone (74 ), was described by Miski et al. (1983) . The 8-hydroxylated flavones are rare in Salvia , with 8-hydroxyapigenin 7-methyl ether (salvitin) (85 ) being the only representative found in S. plebeia  (Gupta et al., 1975 ) while 8-hydroxyapigenin (isoscutellarein) (84 ) itself was detected by HPLC in sage samples (Cuvelier et al., 1996 ). The four dihydroflavones that have been described to date in Salvia  include 5-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone (86 ) (Gonzalez et al., 1989 ), 5,7-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavanone (isosakuranetin or narigenin-4′-methyl ether) (87 ) (Pereda-Miranda and Delgado, 1986 ), 5,7,3′-trihydroxy-4′-methoxyflavanone (hesperetin) (88 ) (Cuvelier et al., 1996 ) and 5,3′-dihydroxy-7,4′-dimethoxyflavanone (89 ). The last mentioned compound was also found to possess coronary dilator activity (Chen et al., 1986 ). Flavonols are mostly those of kaempferol (5,7,4′-trihydroxyflavonol) and quercetin (5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavonol) methyl ethers. Kaempferol (90 ) itself was present in S. farinacea  (Kamel et al., 1992 ) and S. folium  (Tamas et al., 1986 ) while quercetin was only reported in S. dorrii  (Wollenweber et al., 1992 ). Kaempferol 3-methyl ether (isokaempferide) (91 ), 3,7-dimethyl ether (kumatakenin) (92 ) and quercetin 3-methyl ether (94 ), 3′-methyl ether (isorhamnetin) (95 ), 3,3′-dimethyl ether (96 ) and 3,7,4′-trimethyl ether (ayanin) (97 ) are also known Salvia  constituents (Topcu et al., 1996; Gökdil et al., 1997 ). Kaempferol-3-methyl ether, together with seven other flavones were identified in S. yosgadensis  (Topcu et al., 1996 ). Quercetin 3,7,3′,4′-tetramethyl ether, or retusin (98 ) was identified by TLC in S. glutinosa  (Wollenweber, 1974 ). 6-Hydroxylated flavonols are mostly confined to 6-hydroxykaempferol derivatives and include 6-hydroxykaempferol 3,6-dimethyl ether (99 ) (Gökdil et al., 1997 ), 3,6,4′-trimethyl ether (santin) (100 ) (Ulubelen and Tuzlaci, 1990 ) and interestingly the 5,6-dimethyl ether (101 ) (Wollenweber et al., 1992 ). Compound 101  is one of the only two flavone 5-methyl ethers known to Salvia  species, the other being 6-hydroxygalangin 5,6-dimethyl ether (102 ) found in S. columbariae  (Wollenweber et al., 1992 ) which is also the only one galangin (5,7-dihydroxyflavonol) compound reported in Salvia . No corresponding 6-hydroxyquercetin derivatives have been described so far in Salvia .  3.2 Flavone and flavonol glycosides Flavone O -glycosides are apparently common in Salvia  and most of them are flavone 7-glycosides represented by apigenin 7-glucoside (cosmosiin) (103 ), luteolin 7-glucoside (cinaroside) (110 ) and their corresponding 7-glucuronides (104 , 111 ). There are several apigenins glycosylated with two or more sugars and among these are apigenin 7,4′-diglucoside (105 ) (Takeda et al., 1994 ), apigenin 7-cellobioside (107 ) (Veitch et al., 1998 ), apigenin 7-rutinoside (108 ) (Kokkalou and Kapetanidis, 1988 ) and apigenin 7-cellobioside-4′-glucoside (109 ) (Veitch et al., 1998 ). The latter compound is the only trisaccharide of flavones and together with apigenin 7,4′-diglucoside are the only two apigenin derivatives in which two phenolic hydroxyl groups are glycosylated. Apigenin 7,4′-diglucoside occurred as a co-pigment in the blue flower of S. patens  (Takeda et al., 1994 ). Other flavone disaccharides like apigenin 7-cellobioside and apigenin 7-cellobioside-4′-glucoside present in Salvia  flowers could very well serve as co-pigments (Veitch et al., 1998 ). Compared to apigenin, luteolin glycosides appeared to be more common. Luteolin 3′-glucuronide (112 ) was present in S. officinalis  (Lu and Foo, 2000 ) while luteolin 4′-glucuronide (113 ) was found in S. lavandulifolia  along with other flavonoids (Canigueral et al., 1989 ). The 3′-OH of luteolin is often methylated and thus chrysoeriol glycosides such as 7-glucoside (114 ), 7-glucuronide (115 ) and 7-xyloside (116 ) have been frequently reported in Salvia  (Smirnova et al., 1974b; Abdalla et al., 1983 ). Several luteolin disaccharides have been identified in Salvia  and these include luteolin 3′-glucoside-7-glucuronide (117 ) (Abdalla et al., 1983 ), 7-rutinoside (118 ) (Kokkalou and Kapetanidis, 1988; Tomas-Lorente et al., 1988 ), 7-cellobioside (119 ) (Abdalla, 1984 ) and 5-rutinoside (127 ) (Zarzuelo et al., 1995 ). The 6-hydroxyflavone glycosides, like their aglycones, are also important constituents of Salvia.  While 6-hydroxyapigenin glycosides are exclusively those of 6-methylated derivatives such as 6-methoxyapigenin 7-glucoside (homoplantagenin) (120 ) and 7-glucuronide (121 ), salvigenin 5-glucoside (122 ) (Abdalla et al., 1983; Ulubelen and Topcu, 1984 ), the corresponding 6-hydroxyluteolin glycosides are evenly distributed between those that are methylated and unmethylated, thus 6-hydroxyluteolin 7-glucoside (123 ) and 7-glucuronide (124 ) (Lu and Foo, 2000 ), 6-methoxyluteolin 7-glucoside (nepitrin) (125 ), 7-glucuronide (126 ) (Abdalla et al., 1983 ), 6-hydroxyluteolin 5-glucoside (128 ) (Ulubelen et al., 1981 ) and 6-methoxyluteolin 7-methyl ether-5-glucoside (129 ) (Saleh and Sabri, 1980 ) have all been found in Salvia . Another compound, identified as acetylpectolinarin by Smirnova et al. (1974a) , could likely be 6-methoxyapigenin 4′-methyl ether-7-rutinoside, as its acidic hydrolysis gave pectolinarigenin (6-hydroxyapigenin 6,4′-dimethyl ether) together with glucose and rhamnose. Flavone C -glycosides are widespread in nature and those present in Salvia  are mostly those of apigenin including apigenin 8-C -glucoside (vitexin) (130 ) and apigenin 8-C -arabinoside (schaftoside) (131 ) from S. blepharophylla  (Bisio et al., 1997 ) and the more common apigenin 6,8-di-C -glucoside (vicenin-2) (132 ) (Abdalla, 1984; Lu and Foo, 2000 ). Luteolin 6,8-di-C -glucoside (133 ) from S. aegypteacae  (Abdalla, 1984 ) is the only example of luteolin C -glycosides reported. The flavonol glycosides found in Salvia  are exclusively those of the 3-glycosides. There are three kaempferol glycosides known but they cover a range of compounds from mono- to triglycoside which are exemplified by kaempferol 3-glucoside (astragalin) (134 ) in S. cavaleriei  (Zhao et al., 1997 ), 3-robinoside (141 ) and 3-(2,6-dirhamnosylglucoside) or 3-(2G -rhamnosylrutinoside) (135 ) in S. farnacea  (Kamel et al., 1992 ). The quercetin glycosides also include their methyl ethers, thus in addition to the more common 3-glucoside (isoquercitrin) (137 ), 3-glucuronide (miquelianin) (138 ) and 3-robinoside (142 ), all of which occur in S. blepharophylla  (Bisio et al., 1997 ), rhamnetin (quercetin 7-methyl ether) 3-glucoside (139 ) from S. blepharophylla  (Bisio et al., 1997 ), isorhamnetin (quercetin 3′-methyl ether) 3-galactoside (140 ) and 3-(2G -rhamnosylrutinoside) (136 ) both from S. farinacea  (Kamel et al., 1992 ) have also been reported.  3.3 Anthocyanins The anthocyanins are particularly abundant in the red or purple flowers of Salvia  (Asen, 1961; Shibata et al., 1966; Cornu and Paynot, 1969; Albulescu and Gavrila-Dinu, 1981; Zhang et al., 1997 ). Salvia  anthocyanins (see Table 5  ) were first studied by Willstätter and Bolton (1916)  and the pigment known as salvianin was identified as pelargonidin diglucoside with caffeic acid and malonic acid substituents. Subsequent investigations led to the first structural assignment of salvianin as pelargonidin 3-(6-caffeoylglucoside)-5-glucoside (145 ) (Birkofer et al., 1965 ), but this structure was later revised to pelargonidin 3-(6-caffeoylglucoside)-5-(4,6-dimalonylglucoside) (143 ) (Kondo et al., 1989 ). The earlier structure was revised because plant pigments were extracted with alcohols which were acidified with mineral acids causing hydrolysis of the labile malonyl moiety (Tomas-Barberan et al., 1987 ). The mono- and bis-demalonyl derivatives of salvianin (144 , 145 ) have also been identified (Tomas-Barberan et al., 1987; Kondo et al., 1989 ). Furthermore, the caffeoyl group in salvianin can be replaced by a p -coumaroyl group, leading to the corresponding pelargonidin 3-(6-p -coumaroylglucoside)-5-(4,6-dimalonylglucoside) or monardaein (146 ) and its demalonated derivatives (147 , 148 ) (Tomas-Barberan et al., 1987 ). Likewise, the pelargonidin aglycone can be replaced by cyanidin, delphinidin and even malvidin, so the respective cyanidin and delphinidin 3-(caffeoylglucoside)-5-(dimalonylglucosides) (149 , 155 ) or 3-(p -coumaroylglucoside)-5-(dimalonylglucosides) (152 , 158 ) and their demalonated derivatives (150 , 151 , 153 , 154 , 156 , 157 , 159 , 160 ) have all been identified in scarlet, purple and blue flowers of Salvia  (Takeda et al., 1986; Tomas-Barberan et al., 1987; Kondo et al., 1989 ). Malvidin 3-(6-p -coumaroylglucoside)-5-(6-malonylglucoside) (salviamalvin) (162 ), along with malonylawobanin (159 ), have been isolated from the blue flowers of S. farinacea  (Kondo et al., 1989 ). Studies on the distribution pattern of anthocyanins in 10 species of Salvia  showed that the red, scarlet and pink-coloured flower varieties contained pelargonidin, the blue ones the delphinidin and the amethyst- and grape-violet-colored ones were the cyanidin derivatives (Haque et al., 1981 ). An acetylated anthocyanin, delphinidin 3-(6-p -coumaroylglucoside)-5-(4-acetyl-6-malonylglucoside) (161 ) together with its parent compound have been reported in the blue petals of S. uliginosa  (Ishikawa et al., 1999 ). An example of a stable complex of anthocyanins with flavonoids as co-pigments is a blue pigment found in the blue flowers of S. patens . The pigment is composed of delphinidin 3-(6-p -coumaroylglucoside)-5-(6-malonylglucoside) (malonylawobanin) (159 ), apigenin 7,4′-diglucoside (105 ) and magnesium cation (Takeda et al., 1994 ).  3.4 Proanthocyanidins Proanthocyanidins, or condensed tannins, have been reported in Salvia  species (Brieskorn, 1949; Savin and Ivanic, 1973; Murko and Baldasar, 1977 ). The so-called salviatannin (164 ) has only been investigated with UV and IR and deduced to be based on catechin (163 ) which gave catechol and catechuic acid after alkali pyrolysis (Murko et al., 1974 ). Later, salviatannin was also detected by paper chromatography followed by spraying color reagent (Hu, 1982 ) or analysed by absorption onto hide powder followed by gravimetry (Karuza-Stojakovic et al., 1989 ). The tannins present in Salvia  intravenous preparations could be removed by passing through a polyamide column (Hu, 1982 ) or by precipitation with 5% gelatin solutions followed by filtration (Ren et al., 1986 ).   4 Conclusion Salvia  species commonly called sages are widely used in traditional medicine and are a rich source of polyphenolic flavonoids and phenolic acids. Flavones, flavonols and their glycosides constitute the majority of flavonoids present. Malonylated anthocyanins are abundant in red to blue Salvia  flowers while the presence of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) in Salvia  have not been demonstrated conclusively. The phenolic acids are exclusively those based on caffeic acid building block with compounds formed from two to four or more caffeic acid units. The depsides formed from these are believed to be responsible for the many biological activities in the sage decoction used in traditional medicine. In addition to the dried root, the aerial part of sage has been shown to also contain a rich source of polar polyphenols including flavonoids and phenolic acids which could potentially be used also as herbal materials.
