 The tetrasaccharides lacto-N -tetraose (1 ) and lacto-N -neotetraose (2 ) are amongst the oligosaccharides isolated from human milk [1,2] ; the former was the first aminodeoxy oligosaccharide that was found to occur free in nature [3–5] . Oligosaccharides 1  and 2  represent core structural elements of more complex oligosaccharides in human milk [1,2] , in glycolipids, such as paragloboside and sialosylparagloboside, and in glycoproteins. These oligosaccharides are useful in the recognition of the acceptor specificity of glycosyltransferases, the substrate specificity of glycosidases, and the structure of antigenic determinants [1] . Thus, the sequence contained in lacto-N -neotetraose had been recognized by an antibody bound to granulocytes that was obtained by immunization with normal human granulocytes [6] . Paragloboside, a lactoneotetraosyl ceramide, was first isolated from human erythrocytes [7] ; it was also identified as a specific surface component of virus polyoma-transformed hamster embryo fibroblast cells [8]  and thus it may act as surface antigen associated with this tumor [9] . The Neu5Ac α-(2→6)-lacto-N -neotetraose was found to cause inhibition of the bacterial infection of a human patient suffering from pneumonia [10] . Both 1  and 2  act as bacterial receptors for pneumococci [11,12] . The pentasaccharide HSO3 -3Gal-β-(1→3)-GlcNAc-β-(1→3)-Gal-β-(1→4)Glc is one of the most potent oligosaccharide ligands for human E-selectin [13] . It is a strong supporter of the adhesion of E-selectin-expressing cells and an inhibitor of E-selectin adhesion. Such inhibitors may be used for the treatment of disorders of inflammation and for minimizing risk of metastasis after surgery reactions of tumors [13–15] . Partially protected lacto-N -neotetraoses were prepared as intermediates for the synthesis of blood group I-active biantennary neolacto-type decaosyl ceramide [16,17] . One of the crucial points in the syntheses of oligosaccharides incorporating 2-amino-2-deoxy-d -glucose necessitates its availability as a donor that requires a suitable protection of the amino group. Various protecting groups for such purposes are now available. Thus, the 2-deoxy-2-phthalimido sugars were used as glycosyl donors for the synthesis of lacto-N -neotetraose derivatives [16,17] , of p -nitrophenyl lacto-N -tetraoside [18] , and of benzyl lacto-N -neotetraoside [19] . Also lacto-N -biose was prepared by the phthalimide method [20,21] . The benzyl glycoside of 2 [22]  as well as the ceramide of 1 [23]  were prepared by using 2-azido-2-deoxy glucose as a precursor for the N -acetylglucosamine moiety. The methyl lacto-N -neotetraoside and derivatives thereof were prepared by the phthalimide method [24–26]  and the oxazoline method [27,28] . The latter method was also used for the synthesis of lacto-N -tetraose by a route utilizing the oxazoline derivative of β-d -galactopyranosyl-(1→3)-d -glucosamine (lacto-N -biose I) as a donor for a suitably protected lactose acceptor [29–31] . Also the 2-O -methyl derivative of the galactose moiety at the non-reducing end has been prepared via the oxazoline method [32] . Recently, we introduced the dimethylmaleoyl (DMM) group as a new amino protecting group for glucosamine [33] . Its ease of attachment and subsequent cleavage as well as its electron-withdrawing property make the d -glucosamine derivative a good glycosyl donor with an enforced capability of forming a β-linkage. Moreover, versatile glycosyl acceptors containing the dimethylmaleoylamido group could also be generated and successfully employed in glycosylation reactions [33] . Owing to these perspectives of the DMM group, we report herein synthetic routes, using this group, to the biologically important lacto-N -neotetraose (2 ) and lacto-N -tetraose (1 ). The generated building blocks also allow their further use as donors or acceptors for the preparation of various oligosaccharides.  2 2. Results and discussion For the synthesis of the target tetrasaccharides, final linkage of two disaccharides has been designed. Thus, the disaccharide donor will have the glucosamine residue containing the DMM group at the reducing end. The required disaccharide donor 7  was synthesized in three steps from known acceptor 4 [33]  by its galactosidation with known trichloroacetimidate 3 [34]  under the catalysis of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (Me3 SiOTf) to give the β-linked disaccharide 5  in 84% yield. Its 1 H NMR spectrum supported the assignment; two doublets for H-1 and H-1′ at δ  5.10 and 4.61 with a J  value of 8.0 Hz for each indicated the axial nature of H-1 and H-2 in both rings. The tert -butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) group was cleaved from 5  with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) to give 6 , which can be readily transformed into the trichloroacetimidate donor 7 . Its reaction with the known disaccharide acceptor benzyl (2,4,6-tri-O -benzyl-β-d -galactopyranosyl)-(1→4)-2,3,6-tri-O -benzyl-β-d -glucopyranoside (8 ) [35]  gave the desired tetrasaccharide 9 ; the 13 C NMR spectrum showed the presence of four signals at δ  100.20, 100.70, 102.70, and 102.80 corresponding to the four β-linked anomeric carbons. Deblocking of the DMM group from 9  with NaOH to open the DMM ring followed by treatment with HCl to cleave the presumably formed butenolide and then intermediate acetylation gave 10  in 71% yield. On the other hand, using hydrazine hydrate as a deblocking agent followed by acetylation led to the formation of 10  in 54% yield. The success of this transformation was readily confirmed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, which exhibited the disappearance of the methyl signals of the dimethylmaleoyl group and the appearance of an NH signal at δ  5.8 and of a new methyl signal. Catalytic hydrogenation led to deblocking of the benzyl groups which, upon acetylation, gave 11  in 95% yield as the peracetyl derivative of 2 . The 1 H NMR spectrum of 11  indicated its presence as a mixture of α (δ  6.23) and β (δ  5.64) anomers in a ratio of 3:2. Almost the same ratio was also reported based on the calculation of specific rotations [28]  and 1 H NMR spectroscopy [21] . Deacylation of 11  gave 2  in 91% yield. The 13 C NMR data of 2  were in accordance with published values [35] ; reacetylation of 2  led again to compound 11 , thus confirming the structure of 2  (Scheme 1  ). For the synthesis of the lacto-N -tetraose 1 , two approaches were designed. Both methods were based on the coupling of a disaccharide donor with the disaccharide acceptor 8 [36] . The designation of these two routes has been developed in order to allow for the presence of temporary blocking groups on the resulting tetrasaccharide thus making it suitable as acceptor for other mono- and oligosaccharide donors. In the first approach known donor 12 [33]  was coupled with 8  to give 13  in 76% yield. Although its 1 H NMR spectrum showed a doublet at δ  5.27 for the newly formed glycosidic bond with a J  value of 8.4 Hz confirming its β-configuration, the signals for the anomeric protons are hidden under other signals. However, their coupling with H-2 can be depicted from the signals for H-2. On the other hand, the 13 C NMR spectrum showed signals at δ c  100.30, 100.50, and 102.80 corresponding to the four β-linked anomeric carbons. Debenzylidenation of 13  with p -TsOH gave 14  whose NMR spectra showed the absence of the benzylidene CH. The transformation of the DMM group to an acetyl group was achieved by the action of alkali and then acidification followed by acetylation to give 15  in 76% yield. Catalytic hydrogenation of 15 , followed by acetylation, gave the peracetyl derivative 16  as a mixture of α and β anomers in a ratio of 1:2, respectively (Scheme 2  ). Alternatively, the required disaccharide donor 21  was prepared from known 17 [33]  by debenzylidenation with p -TsOH to give 18  whose O-acetylation gave 19 . Subsequent removal of the TBDMS group with TBAF gave 1-O-unprotected 20 , thus being suitable for the activation with trichloroacetonitrile in the presence of DBU to give trichloroacetimidate 21 . Coupling of 21  with 8  under standard conditions gave tetrasaccharide 22  in 75% yield. Its 1 H NMR spectrum showed for the H-1c a doublet at δ  5.16 with a coupling constant of 8.4 Hz, thus confirming the β-configuration. Moreover, its 13 C NMR spectrum showed signals at δ c  99.90, 100.50, 102.8 (2C), confirming the presence of the four anomeric centers. Removal of the DMM group from 22  and subsequent acetylation afforded 15 , which was identical to the material obtained via the first approach (Scheme 3  ). In conclusion, lacto-N -tetraose (1 ) and lacto-N -neotetraose (2 ) were successfully synthesized by the elaboration of the newly developed protection of amino sugars with dimethylmaleic anhydride providing the dimethylmaleimido group. Cleavage by addition of alkali followed by acid can be successfully performed as exhibited in our first report [33] , using this group for amino sugars, and in other reports, using it for amino acids and proteins [37–41] . Its combination with the trichloroacetimidate leaving group [42]  at C-1 of a glucosamine residue either in monomeric form or as part of an oligosaccharide provides good glycosyl donors in order to form β-linkages. Moreover, the DMM group tolerates manipulations of the common temporary protective groups required during oligosaccharide synthesis and, in addition, it can be selectively removed under quite mild conditions. The partially protected target tetrasaccharides prepared in this paper, as well as their precursors, can be used for the elaboration of various higher oligosaccharides.  3 3.
