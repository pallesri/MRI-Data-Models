 To develop positron-emitting tracers for positron emission tomography (PET) studies, ex vivo  autoradiography (ARG) is a useful technique to demonstrate the distribution of the tracer in the brain as well as in the whole body. A recent advent of radioluminography using phosphor-imaging plates (12, 14)  has enabled the ex vivo  ARG to be applied to ultrashort-lived 11 C-labeled tracers. Yanai et al.  reported a potential of the imaging plates for receptor ARG with 11 C-labeled ligands compared with tritiated ligands (25) . Planas et al. (18)  characterized a cholinesterase inhibitor [11 C]physostigmine using a similar type storage phosphor plates. We also used imaging plates to characterize newly developed 11 C-labeled receptor ligands (3, 10, 16) . Because the intensity of photo-stimulated-luminescence (PSL) is linearly proportional to the radioactivity in a wide range, ARG images expressed as PSL is considered to reflect the quantitative distribution of radioactivity. Recently, Sihver et al. (21)  have quantitatively evaluated in vitro  ARG with storage phosphor plates and 11 C-flumazenil. In the present paper, we describe quantitative evaluation of ex vivo  and in vitro  ARG using an imaging plate and a 11 C-labeled dopamine D2 -like receptor ligand, [11 C]nemonapride ([11 C]YM-09151-2) (5, 6, 8, 9, 11) . Its tritiated compound has been used widely for pharmacological studies as one of representative dopamine D2 -like receptor ligands. We report the presence of saturable binding sites for [11 C]nemonapride in the cortex beside the dopamine D2 -like receptors in the striatum both ex vivo  and in vitro.   Materials and methods [11 C]Nemonapride (9)  and [11 C]SCH 23390 (4)  were synthesized by 11 C-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl compound with [11 C]methyl iodide by the method previously described. The specific activity of the compounds was measured as follows. The radioactivity (MBq) of an appropriate volume of tracer solution was measured by a radioisotope calibrator (type CRC-712, Capintec Inc., Ramsey, NJ), and a part of the solution was applied to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the mass (nmol) of the compounds based on the ultraviolet (UV) response to the authentic sample. Male Wistar rats (8–10 weeks old) were obtained from Tokyo Laboratory Animals Company (Tokyo, Japan). The animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Calibration of PSL Relationship between PSL and radioactivity on filter paper A solution of 11 C-tracer was prepared at the concentration of 100 MBq/mL measured with a radioisotope calibrator (t  = 0 min, 26 min after end of bombardment [EOB]). The solution was diluted to 0.03–10 MBq/mL, and 10 μL of each diluted solution (0.3–100 kBq) was loaded on six pieces of filter paper (5 mm × 5 mm, 0.23 ± 0.05 mm thickness, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Tokyo, Japan). Three pieces of the filter paper were exposed on an imaging plate of type IP BAS SR (FUJIX Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) until the decay-out of 11 C (t  = 20 h). The activity at the start of contact ranged from 1.05 to 2990 Bq (t  = 35.5 min). At the same time, the radioactivity (cpm) of the other three pieces of the filter paper was measured with a well-type auto-gamma counter (type 1282 Compugamma CS, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) for 15 s, and the cpm/Bq was computed with decay correction. The PSL values over the entire piece of filter paper (25 mm2 ) were measured with a bioimaging analyzer of type BAS 2500 (FUJIX Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan), to compute the PSL per Bq at the start of contact.  Reproducibility between imaging plates The filter paper provided with the 11 C-radioactivity as described above and the autoradiographic [14 C]micro-scales (1.11–31.73 kBq/g) (Amersham International plc., Buckinghamshire, England) were exposed to five imaging plates of the same type for 4 h to examine the reproducibility between imaging plates; the PSL of the micro-scales were measured as PSL/mm2 .   Ex vivo  autoradiography Effect of section thickness [11 C]Nemonapride (143 MBq/4.3 nmol) was injected intravenously into a rat (235 g) (t  = 0 min, 29 min after EOB). Fifteen minutes later, the rat was killed and the brain was removed. The brain at the bregma (17) was cut into 10-, 15-, 20-, 30-, 75-, 100-, and 150-μm thick coronal sections using a cryotome (Bright Instruments Co. Ltd., UK) at −15°C. The brain sections were thaw-mounted on glass plates (20 × 32 mm2 ) that were precoated with 3% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in acetone. The sections were dried on a hot plate at 60°C and apposed placed on an imaging plate (t  = 110 min). The tracer uptake was visualized as described above. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on the striatum (6–8 mm2 ) and on the cerebral cortex (6–8 mm2 ), and the PSL/mm2 values were measured. From the other rat (230 g) given [11 C]nemonapride (136 MBq/4.4 nmol), the coronal brain sections with 10-, 15-, 20-, 30-, 75-, 100-, and 150-μm thickness were also obtained as described above. The whole section was measured for the radioactivity (cpm) with an auto-gamma counter for 15 s. The effect of section thickness was evaluated, assuming equal radioactivity concentration between corresponding regions or whole brains in neighboring sections at the bregma.  Relationship between PSL and radioactivity on the brain section To obtain coronal brain sections having a wider range of radioactivity, ex vivo  ARG was performed with [11 C]SCH 23390, which is more concentrated in the striatum than [11 C]nemonapride. [11 C]SCH 23390 (236 MBq/11.1 nmol and 47 MBq/2.2 nmol) was injected intravenously into two rats (t  = 0 min, 30 min after EOB). The rats were killed 15 min later, and 25 pairs of the adjacent coronal brain sections with 20-μm thickness were prepared throughout the brain as described above. One set of the brain sections was applied to an imaging plate until decay-out to measure the PSL for the whole section, and the other set was measured for the radioactivity (cpm) with an auto-gamma counter (t  = 102 min). Then the PSL/cpm was calculated for each brain section.  Regional brain uptake of [11 C]nemonapride measured by ex vivo  ARG and tissue sampling method [11 C]Nemonapride (82.6–96.7 MBq/2.1–5.7 nmol) was injected intravenously into four rats (260–290 g). They were killed 30 min later and the brains were removed. From a half brain hemisphere, three pairs of adjacent coronal brain sections with 20-μm thickness were cut near bregma. The radioactivity (cpm) of one set of section was measured with an auto-gamma counter and converted to Bq. The other section was exposed to an imaging plate to measure the PSL for the whole section as described above, and the PSL/Bq was calculated assuming that the pair of adjacent brain sections had the same radioactivity. ROIs were placed on the striatum and on the cortex to measure the PSL for the regional brain section volume (mm2  × 0.02 mm), which was converted to Bq/mL. Then, the uptake of [11 C]nemonapride by the striatum or cortex was assessed as the percent of the injected dose per milliliter of tissue (%ID/mL). From the other hemisphere the striatum and cortex were dissected and weighed, and the radioactivity of the tissues was measured with an auto-gamma counter. The uptake was expressed as the percent of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).  Effect of carrier dose To measure the receptor binding capacity quantitatively in ex vivo  ARG, the amount of injected carrier ligand must be sufficiently small to avoid saturation effect. To determine if the carrier amount of nemonapride meets this requirement under the specific activity of current experimental condition, the effect of carrier dose on the regional uptake of [11 C]nemonapride was evaluated by tissue sampling. [11 C]Nemonapride with various amount of carrier (10 MBq/0.027–500 nmol) was injected into rats (227 ± 12 g), and the uptake (%ID/g) by the striatum, cortex, and cerebellum was measured at 30 min after the injection by the tissue sampling method as described above.   In vitro  autoradiography Effect of section thickness In vitro  ARG with [11 C]nemonapride was performed according to the method of Przedborski et al. (19)  with a slight modification. Coronal rat brain sections with 10-, 20-, 30-, 75-, 100-, and 150-μm thickness near the bregma (17)  were prepared. The brain sections were pre-incubated in 100 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 120 mM NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the same buffer containing 100 kBq/mL (25 TBq/mmol) [11 C]nemonapride was prepared (t  = 0 min, 29 min after EOB), in which all the sections were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After being washed with ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM NaCl, the brain sections were dried on a hot plate at 60°C, and then contacted on an imaging plate (t  = 58 min) until the activity decayed out (t  = 20 h) . The binding of 11 C was measured as the PSL/mm2  over the ROIs placed in the same manner as in the ex vivo  ARG, and the effect of section thickness was evaluated. The other set of the brain section was also assayed as described above and the radioactivity (cpm) of the whole section was measured with a gamma counter.  Saturation of [11 C]nemonapride binding The buffer containing various concentrations (0.156, 0.313, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.50 nM) of [11 C]nemonapride (21 TBq/mmol) was prepared (t  = 0 min, 40 min after EOB), and six brain sections with 20-μm thickness were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in each buffer as described above. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating adjacent six sections in the medium to which haloperidol was added to a final concentration of 20 μM. Three brain sections in each assay were exposed on an imaging plate (t  = 85 min) to measure the PSL values, and the adjacent three sections were measured for radioactivity (cpm). Then, the PSL/Bq calculated as described above was converted to concentration of receptor-bound ligand (nmol/mL tissue) using the specific activity of the ligand. Scatchard plot, bound ligand (nmol/mL tissue) versus bound ligand/free ligand (nmol/mL tissue/nM), was carried out.    Results and discussion Relationship between PSL and radioactivity on filter paper Figure 1   shows the PSL values of the standard sample on filter paper. The PSL values were linearly proportional to the 11 C radioactivity (Bq) measured with a radioisotope calibrator (Fig. 1A) , and the ratio was 10.7 PSL/Bq at the start of contact. Because each sample presented uniform activity distribution within the piece of filter paper, the PSL of the standard sample on the filter paper was expressed as a linear function of radioactivity in the range from 0.4 to 1110 PSL/mm2  (0.04–104 Bq/mm2 ) in the present study. The linearity between the radioisotope calibrator and the well-type gamma counter was also confirmed, the ratio being 40.1 cpm/Bq.  Reproducibility between imaging plates When the 11 C-samples on filter paper and standard [14 C]micro-scales were exposed to five imaging plates, the coefficient variation (SD/mean) of the five plates for 11 C-sensitivity and 14 C-sensitivity was 2.4–3.2% at 17.4–164 PSL/mm2  and 2.6–6.9% at 5.2–36.6 PSL/mm2 , respectively. The variation for 11 C was comparable to that for 14 C, which confirmed the reliability of our homemade standard source on filter paper.  Effect of section thickness Figure 2   shows representative autoradiograms of [11 C]nemonapride by ex vivo  and in vitro  ARG. High 11 C density was observed in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle, consistent with the well-known distribution of dopamine D2  receptors. Figure 3   illustrates the relationship between brain section thickness and PSL values measured by ex vivo  and in vitro  ARG. The PSL/mm2  value for ex vivo  ARG was not linearly proportional to the slice thickness (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that the absorption of radiation increases as the section thickness increases, because it is reasonably assumed that the radioactivity of [11 C]nemonapride was uniformly distributed throughout the thickness in the striatum and cortex near the bregma. On the other hand, a deviation from the linear function was much larger for the in vitro  ARG than for the ex vivo  ARG, and the PSL/mm2  values reached a plateau both in the striatum and cortex for over 100-μm thick sections. This finding is probably because diffusion of the 11 C-tracer into the brain tissue was not completed in thick brain sections during the incubation period, and the binding did not reach an equilibrium state. The explanation was approved by measurement of radioactivity of the whole brain sections with a gamma counter (Fig. 3C) . The radioactivity was linearly proportional to the slice thickness in ex vivo  ARG, but not in in vitro  ARG.  Relationship between PSL and radioactivity on the brain section Figure 4   shows relationship between the PSL value and the radioactivity of 11 C on the whole section with 20-μm thickness and for the entire piece of 25-mm2  filter paper with 230-μm thickness. The PSL was found to be linearly proportional to the radioactivity within the brain sections or filter paper, although the coefficient was different between the two materials because of different thickness as suggested from Figure 2 . Therefore, the PSL value can be converted to the radioactivity expressed as Bq unit, if the radioactivity of the adjacent brain sections with the same thickness is measured with a gamma-counter. Table 1  summarizes the uptake of [11 C]nemonapride by the striatum and cortex measured by ex vivo  ARG and by the tissue sampling. Comparable values of the striatal and cortical uptake were obtained by the two methods, nevertheless the technical problem that the nonstriatal region might be contaminated with the striatal sample in the tissue sampling, and the fact that the uptake of [11 C]nemonapride is less homogeneous in the striatum than in the cortex. Therefore, ex vivo  ARG may be a suitable method to quantitatively evaluate small regions such as nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercles.  Effect of carrier dose To evaluate the carrier dose on the regional brain uptake of [11 C]nemonapride, the uptake was measured by tissue sampling method. As shown in Figure 5 ,   at the dose of 22 nmol/kg the uptake was slightly decreased, though not statistically significant. In the regional brain distribution study with ex vivo  ARG and tissue sampling (Table 1) , the injected doses were 320–330 MBq/kg as radioactivity and 8.1–20 nmol/kg as carrier amounts. Therefore, the injected carrier dose of [11 C]nemonapride slightly exceeded to the optimum condition. However, because the PSL/mm2  values measured in the cortex were 12–14 at 65–70 min after the tracer injection (at 35–40 min after the exposing time) in the study described in Table 1 , the injected dose for the [11 C]nemonapride can be reasonably reduced to approximately one-tenth within the linearity range for the PSL/mm2  (>0.4 in Fig. 1 ), although statistical noise is increased. Therefore, the quantitative ex vivo  ARG method using imaging plates presented in this study is applicable to quantitative measurement of the receptor binding capacity with [11 C]nemonapride. It can also be applied to other dopamine receptor ligands such as [11 C]raclopride, [11 C]N -methylspiperone, and [11 C]SCH 23390 (data not shown), although the uptake depends in the ligand. Figure 5  also showed that a saturable uptake of [11 C]nemonapride was observed in the cortex and cerebellum besides in the striatum, which was preliminarily suggested by a previous report (5) .  In vitro  [11 C]Nemonapride binding to the striatum and cortex In previous studies on in vitro  binding of radiolabeled nemonapride ([3 H]YM-09151-2) at room temperature, the tracer binding reached equilibrium after 90 min (2, 15, 24) . In our preliminary experiment, when the incubation was carried out at 37°C to accelerate the equilibration, the [11 C]nemonapride binding reached a maximal level at 30 min (data not shown), which enabled the use of the short-lived 11 C-ligand. The specific activity of [11 C]nemonapride was reasonably high (25 TBq/mmol at the start of assay in the present study) compared with conventional in vitro  ARG using 3 H-labeled compounds. Thus the in vitro  ARG with [11 C]nemonapride is a practicable technique. The period required from the end of radiosynthesis to the exposing the brain slice to imaging plate was approximately 90 min. A saturation binding experiment showed a specific binding of [11 C]nemonapride to the striatum and cortex (Fig. 6A) .   Scatchard analysis indicated a Kd  of 730 pM and an apparent Bmax  of 160 nmol/mL tissue in the striatum and a Kd  of 1.5 nM and a Bmax  of 29 nmol/mL tissue in the cortex. The Kd  value of 730 pM for the striatum is in the same order as those obtained with in vitro ARG by Unis et al.  (626 pM) (24)  and Yokoyama et al.  (315 pM) (26) , but is larger than those (21–82 pM) measured by the membrane binding assay (1, 13, 15, 23)  or with in vitro  ARG (2) . These differences may be caused by the assay conditions such as incubation time, temperature, blockers used to evaluate the nonspecific binding, other medium components, and slice thickness in ARG. The saturation kinetics may also be different between the membrane homogenate and the brain slice. An in vivo  saturation binding experiment in Figure 6  revealed the presence of saturable binding sites for [11 C]nemonapride in the cortex and striatum. This finding was also revealed by an ex vivo  study (Fig. 5) , which also suggested the presence of saturable binding sites in the cerebellum. The specific binding evaluated with a haloperidol-blockade was lower than the nonspecific binding in the cortex (Fig. 6A -2). Kazawa et al. (13)  demonstrated that [3 H]nemonapride binding in the cortical membrane was displaced by sulpiride or by haloperidol. They also showed that these binding sites were apparently different from serotonin-2 receptors. The unknown binding sites may be dopamine D4  receptors, because haloperidol, but not raclopride, displaced the uptake (20) . Sigma receptors may be another candidate for the unknown binding sites. Helmeste et al. (7)  suggested that nemonapride also has an affinity for sigma receptors, which was evaluated by a blocking study with a selective sigma receptor ligand, R (−)-N -(3-phenyl-n -propyl)-1-phenyl-2-aminopropane (PPAP). Preliminary findings indicated that the [11 C]nemonapride uptake was reduced by carrier nemonapride or by haloperidol in the striatum, cortex, and cerebellum of the mouse brain, but that other sigma receptor ligands such as PPAP, (+)-SKF10047, R (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N -propylpiperidine hydrochloride (R [+]-3-PPP) and NE-100 (22)  did not reduce the [11 C]nemonapride uptake by the striatum (unpublished data). The in vivo  affinity of the [11 C]nemonapride for sigma receptors is under investigation. So far, we confirmed in ex vivo  and in vitro  experiments that the saturable binding sites of [11 C]nemonapride are present in the cortex (and probably in the cerebellum) although their characteristics remain unknown.
