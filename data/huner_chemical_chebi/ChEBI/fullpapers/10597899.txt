 The platinum coordination complexes cisplatin, and its less toxic analog, carboplatin represent two of the major drugs currently used in the treatment of cancer. However, for some time it has been recognised that these two drugs are active against broadly the same types of tumour [1] . Thus one major theme of analog development has involved attempting to widen the spectrum of antitumour activity to tumours that are initially, or have become, unresponsive to cisplatin/carboplatin. Despite considerable effort illustrated by the description of hundreds of analogs, and the phase I clinical evaluation of around 25 compounds, only one, carboplatin, is widely registered for use [2 for a review] . While carboplatin, and the orally active platinum drug, JM216 [3,4]  have addressed issues of patient quality of life, in terms of circumvention of tumour resistance to cisplatin, there has been less progress. Current platinum drugs undergoing clinical trial such as oxaliplatin (which has exhibited some activity in colorectal cancer, especially in combination with 5-fluorouracil [5] , and the sterically hindered drug, AMD473 (ZD0473), which demonstrated in vivo circumvention of acquired cisplatin resistance in human tumour xenografts [6]  may provide some widening of the spectrum of antitumor activity obtained with the parent drugs. One rational approach to the discovery of more broad-spectrum third generation platinum drugs is to design novel platinum agents which bind to DNA in a manner distinct from that of cisplatin and carboplatin, which both ultimately form a similar spectrum of DNA adducts [7] . This strategy is probably best exemplified by the discovery of active trans  platinum complexes, initially by Farrell and co-workers [8–10] . This surprising finding broke one of the original structure-activity rules for platinum complexes, namely that only the cis  isomers were endowed with antitumor activity [11] . Active trans  platinum complexes have also been described based on platinum(II) iminoether complexes [12–14]  and as part of our collaboration with the Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, namely JM335 [trans  ammine (cyclohexylaminedichlorodihydroxo) platinum(IV)] [15] . Some of the preclinical antitumor properties of JM335 have been previously described [15–18] . The aim of this study was to undertake a detailed comparative analysis of the cellular pharmacological properties of JM335, its cis  isomer, JM149 and their respective platinum(II) counterparts, trans  ammine(cyclohexylamine) dichloro platinum(II) JM334, and its cis  isomer JM118 (which, notably, has also been shown to be the major in vivo metabolite of the oral platinum drug JM216 [19,21] ). The study has used three human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, the parent relatively cisplatin-sensitive, CH1, an acquired cisplatin-resistant subline, CH1cisR, and the relatively intrinsically resistant, SKOV-3. Growth inhibition, cellular transport, DNA platination, gene-specific repair of platinum drug induced DNA adducts and induction of p53 and apoptosis has been determined.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Cell lines Two parent human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, the relatively cisplatin sensitive CH1 and the relatively resistant SKOV-3, have been used [22] . In addition, a subline of CH1 possessing acquired resistance to cisplatin, CH1cisR, has been included. This was derived through in vitro exposure as described previously [23] . These three lines have been used by us previously in studies of cisplatin-induced DNA platination [24]  and apoptosis [25] . Lines were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 10% heat inactivated foetal bovine serum, 2 mM l -glutamine and 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone in 6% CO2 /94% air. Cells were periodically checked and confirmed to be free of Mycoplasma .  2.2 Platinum drugs Cisplatin, JM118, JM149, JM334, and JM335 were synthesised and obtained from The Johnson Matthey Technology Centre (Reading, Berkshire, UK). Structures are shown in Fig. 1  . All drugs were dissolved in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution at between 0.5 and 1 mM and sterile filtered prior to use.  2.3 Assessment of growth inhibition This was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as used previously by us for platinum drugs with these cell lines [3,16,23] . Briefly, aliquots of a single cell suspension were seeded into 96-well microtitre plates (4000 per well) and allowed to attach overnight in 160 μ1 of the above-described growth medium. Platinum drugs (made up fresh immediately before) were then added to the wells (four wells per concentration) at up to ten different concentrations. Platinum drug exposure was for 2 h. Thereafter, drug was carefully washed out using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and growth medium replaced. After 4 days incubation, the number of remaining cells was compared in drug-exposed versus untreated wells using 0.4% SRB (Sigma Chemicals, Poole, UK) dissolved in 1% acetic acid. Growth inhibition is expressed as an IC50  — the concentration required to reduce the absorbance (cell number) in control wells by 50%.  2.4 Platinum uptake and DNA binding Intracellular platinum uptake and DNA binding (total platination) was measured in each cell line following 2 h drug exposure to 10, 25, 50 and 100 μM. For uptake experiments, following drug exposure, cells were washed twice with PBS, detached by scraping into 2 ml ice-cold PBS and sonicated. Results from the uptake experiments are expressed as nmoles Pt (measured using flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy; FAAS, Perkin Elmer 1100b/HGA 700, Beaconsfield, UK) per mg protein (using the Lowry assay). For DNA binding experiments, cells were harvested by centrifugation (800×g  for 5 min) and pellets washed twice with ice cold PBS and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. DNA was then extracted using phenol and ethanol precipitation as described previously [24] . Dried DNA pellets were dissolved overnight at 37°C in 0.2% nitric acid and platinum content measured by FAAS and results expressed as nmoles of platinum per gram of DNA.  2.5 Measurement of Pt/DNA lesions using quantitative PCR Formation and removal of platinum induced lesions was measured in the N-ras  gene by QPCR as described previously [26,27] . Cells in midlog phase (approximately 106 ) were incubated for 5 h with 2×IC50  of drug and harvested by trypsinisation either immediately after removal of drug or following a 24 h incubation in drug free medium. Cells were lysed in 340 μl of solution (400 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 60 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% w/v SDS) plus 100 μl 5 M sodium perchlorate by mixing at 37°C for 20 min and then at 65°C for a further 20 min. A total of 580 μl of chloroform was added to the lysate, the solution mixed on a rotary mixer for 20 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation in a microfuge at top speed for 12 min. Following centrifugation, 330 μl of the upper layer was aliquoted into a new microtube and nuclear material precipitated in two volumes of absolute ethanol. The precipitate was washed twice in 70% ethanol, dried in an incubator over night at 37°C and dissolved in 400 μl H2 O. PCR was performed using 25 μl of DNA sample in a final volume of 100 μl containing; 2 units (0.2 μl) of Taq polymerase (red hot), 4.8 μl of a dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP mix (120 μM each), 3 μl (0.75 mM) MgCl2  10 μl, buffer IV (Advanced Biotechnologies), 5 μl DMSO, 1 μl each of 3′ and 5′ primer sequence, and 1 μCi (α-32 P) dCTP. The amplification of the N-ras  fragment was performed using the forward primer 5′–GCC TGG TTA CTG TGT CCT GT–3′ and the reverse primer 5′–GCC AGC CAC ATC TAC AGT AC–3′. PCR was carried out using a Hybaid Thermal cycler using an initial 2 min denaturation step at 94°C followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min with a final incubation of 4 min at 72°C at the end of the cycling. These conditions were chosen to ensure that the PCR reaction was still in the exponential phase when the reaction had stopped. PCR products were quantified by precipitation of aliquots of 40 μl of reaction mixture with 1 ml ice cold 5% w/v trichloroacetic acid 20 mM tetra sodium pyrophosphate (TCA) and the precipitate captured on Whatman GF/C filters with unincorporated α-32 P-dCTP washed through with 10 ml of the TCA and 10 ml of absolute ethanol. The filters were placed in scintillation fluid and the PCR product quantitated by measuring cpms per minute. Lesions per region (lesion index) were calculated using the formula: −ln Ad /A , where A  represents PCR product (cpm) from control sample and Ad  represents cpm from treated samples. Controls containing 25 and 50% of the control sample were included to ensure that the PCR was quantitative.  2.6 Microscopy Cells were collected 24 h following a 2 h incubation with drug. Detached cells were aspirated from the tissue culture flasks and collected from the culture medium by centrifugation. Attached cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS and removed by incubation with 0.25% trypsin for 5 min prior to collection by centrifugation. For fluorescent microscopy, cells were incubated with propridium iodide (PI) 1 mg/ml for 10 min on ice and nuclei detected by red fluorescence.  2.7 Field inverted gel electrophoresis (FIGE) of DNA Cells were incubated with equitoxic concentrations of agents (2×, 5×, 10×IC50 ) for 2 h and then at 24 h (for CH1 and CH1cisR) or 48 h (for SKOV-3) attached and detached cells were collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets of approximately 5×105  were then incubated in lysis buffer [200 mM Tris, 100 mM EDTA, 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate] containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37°C. RNA was removed by a further 1 h incubation following the addition of 10 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution of RNAase to each 50 μl sample. Aliquots of cell lysate were then added directly to the gel, the wells being sealed with 1% low melting point agarose. FIGE was performed with 1×TAE (40 mM Tris, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA) using a Biorad FIGE mapper. Horizontal gels were run for 20 h in 1×TAE buffer with a forward voltage of 10 V/cm and reverse of 7 V/cm with linear ramping T 1 =1 s and T 2 =12 s. The temperature of the TAE buffer was controlled at 14°C using a Biorad 1000 mini-chiller.  2.8 Western blot analysis Cells (8×106 ) were incubated with equitoxic concentrations (2×IC50 ) of drug for 2 h and attached cells harvested by trypsinisation at various time points following drug exposure. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, to which was added; 500 μl pf 20 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride (PMSF) 100 μl Na orthovanadate (10 mM stock), 100 μl NP40, 100 μl 20% SDS, 2 μl aprotinin (10 mg/ml stock) and 2 μl leupeptin (10 mg/ml stock) and incubated on ice for 1 h). The lysed samples were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatant collected. Samples, adjusted to contain equal protein (50 μg), were diluted 50/50 with Laemmli buffer and incubated at 95°C for 3 min. Approximately 25 μl of sample and 3 μl of standard rainbow marker were loaded onto 8–16% Novex precast PAGE gels and run at 30 mA per gel for 1 h and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 300 mA for 2 h. Following transfer, the membranes were stained with Ponceau S to check the efficiency of the transfer. The membranes were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), excess liquid was drained off and then placed in blocking buffer (154 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 0.5% caesin and 0.02% thimerosal, at pH 7.6) and agitated for 1 h. The membranes were subsequently washed in PBST for 5 min and probed for the protein of interest with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for a specified time. For example, 1 h for p53 and 5 h for bcl-2 and then washed thrice for 10 min with PBST. The membranes were incubated with secondary antibody linked with horse radish peroxidase for at least 1 h and then detected with ECL reagents (Amersham) by autoradiography.  2.9 Statistical analysis Where appropriate, statistical significance was evaluated using the Student’s t -test (two tailed). A P -value of <0.05 was considered significant.   3 Results 3.1 Growth inhibition The growth inhibitory properties of the two pairs of cis  and trans  isomers following 2 h exposure to the three ovarian carcinoma cell lines, are shown in Fig. 2  . Mean IC50  values in μM against CH1 cells were 1.3 for JM118, 3.4 for JM334, 35.3 for JM149 and 18.6 for JM335. A degree of resistance was observed in CH1cisR cells to all four agents; resistance factors (Rf; IC50  resistant/IC50  CH1 cells) were 2.5 for JM118 (IC50  3.3), 1.5 for JM334 (IC50  5.1), 2.3 for JM149 (IC50  83) and 1.6 for JM335 (IC50  31). A similar effect was observed with the SKOV-3 cell line but with Rf values being lower for the two trans  compounds: Rf values of 20.5 for JM118 (IC50  27) and 10 for, JM149 (IC50  350) but only 4.5 for JM334 (IC50  15) and 4.4 for JM335 (IC50  83). The curves are generally similar in shape: At 2×IC50  concentrations, the range in cell kill observed across all four drugs was from 83 to 90%. Typical IC50  values for cisplatin [24]  are CH1 2.5 μM, CH1cisR 7.5 μM (Rf of 3) and SKOV-3 33 μM (Rf of 13). Several points emerge: (1) the Pt(II) compounds JM118 and JM334 are more potent than their platinum(IV) counterparts; (2) the trans  isomer JM335 was more potent than its corresponding cis  isomer, especially in the relatively cisplatin-resistant SKOV-3 cell line. However, with the platinum(II) pair, the cis  compound JM118 was more potent that the trans  JM334 in the CH1 and CH1cisR lines. (3) In terms of resistance factors, the trans  compounds showed better circumvention of cisplatin resistance (lower Rf values) than the cis  compounds; this was most apparent with the intrinsically resistant SKOV-3 cell line (e.g. >4-fold lower Rf value for JM334 versus JM118).  3.2 Platinum accumulation and DNA binding Full dose–response curves (10–100 μM; 2 h exposure) were obtained for each drug using all three cell lines. A generally linear relationship between concentration and platinum accumulation (expressed as nmoles Pt/mg protein) was obtained (data not shown). Comparative accumulation data at a concentration of 50 μM are shown in Fig. 3  A. Platinum accumulation was significantly higher following exposure to the trans  Pt(II) compound JM334 compared to both its cis  isomer JM118 (e.g. 7-fold higher in CH1 and CH1cisR; P <0.005) and compared to its platinum(IV) homolog, JM335. There was little to suggest that reduced accumulation contributed to either the acquired resistance of CH1cisR or the intrinsic resistance of SKOV-3 compared to the parent CH1 line; uptake values were similar for JM118 across all three cell lines, uptake was higher in the resistant lines following exposure to JM149 (13-fold; P <0.005 compared to CH1). Platinum uptake for the two trans  compounds JM334 and JM335 was a little lower in SKOV-3 compared to CH1. Similarly to the accumulation data, representative total DNA platination for the four compounds in the three cell lines are shown in Fig. 3 B (50 μM, 2 h drug exposure). As for the uptake data, there was little difference in DNA platination for JM118 across the three cell lines. In contrast, the very high uptake values observed with the trans  Pt(II) compound JM334 compared to JM118 and its platinum(IV) homolog JM335 (especially in the CH1 and CH1cisR cell lines) did not result in higher DNA platination. Indeed, platination was significantly lower for JM334 versus JM118 in the CH1 and CH1cisR lines (P <0.05). However, higher platination (3-fold, P <0.05 compared to CH1) was observed in the intrinsically cisplatin resistant SKOV-3 cell line with JM334. For the two Pt(IV) compounds, DNA platination was higher (around 2–3-fold) for the trans  compound compared to its cis  isomer.  3.3 Gene-specific repair using QPCR As a further means of studying the cellular pharmacology of these cis  and trans  platinum compounds, the ability of the CH1, CH1cisR and SKOV-3 cell lines to remove/repair lesions induced by the compounds (and cisplatin) has been studied in the N-ras  gene using QPCR. In keeping with published studies using cisplatin [27]  an exposure time of 5 h was used and removal assessed at 24 h post drug removal. Fig. 4  A shows results with the platinum(IV) cis /trans  pair using a concentration of 2×2 h-IC50 . Notably, the parent, cisplatin-sensitive cell line CH1, could not remove lesions by either of the two platinum drugs (illustrated by an increase in lesion index at 24 h compared to 5 h). Similarly, the CH1cisR line could not remove lesions induced by JM149. In contrast, the intrinsically cisplatin resistant SKOV-3 cell line was able to remove adducts formed by the cis  compound (JM149) but not by the trans  compound, JM335. Results for the Pt(II) pair of compounds are shown in Fig. 4 B. In common with observations made with the Pt(IV) compounds, the CH1 cell line (and CH1cisR line) was unable to remove adducts formed by the cis  Pt(II) compound JM118. As for the Pt(IV) pair, notably the SKOV-3 cell line removed adducts formed by the cis  compound JM118 but was unable to remove adducts formed by the trans  isomer, JM334. Data for cisplatin are shown in Table 1  . Results showed a similar pattern of response to that observed for the cis  compounds JM118 and JM149 with removal from DNA of SKOV-3 cells but not the CH1 parental line. In contrast, however, removal of cisplatin-induced lesions was apparent in CH1cisR cells.  3.4 Cell death induced by cis  and trans  platinum compounds As described previously [20,25] , we initially determined the rates of cell death induced by the compounds by measuring cellular detachment from the monolayer over time following 2 h drug exposure. Results for the CH1cisR cell line for all four compounds used at an equitoxic (2×IC50 ) concentration are shown (Fig. 5  ). Similar results were obtained for the CH1 and SKOV-3 cell lines (data not shown and 20 for JM149 and JM335 in the CH1 cell line). Notably, a slower rate of detachment was induced by the two cis  isomers JM118 and JM149 compared to their trans  counterparts. While the time taken for 50% detachment to occur with the trans  compounds was around 24 h, for the two cis  compounds, this was around 72 h. Detection of apoptosis induced by cis  and trans  platinum compounds. To determine whether the cellular detachment and cell death observed in the cell lines. occurred through apoptosis, two complementary means of detecting apoptotic cells was employed; fluorescence microscopy and FIGE of DNA. Fig. 6   shows fluorescent microscopy of detached CH1 cells harvested 24 h after exposure for 2 h to 2× or 10×IC50  of either the cis  Pt(II) compound JM118 or its trans  counterpart, JM334. Using 2×IC50  of the cis  isomer JM118, the majority of detached cells exhibited the classical morphology of apoptosis (condensation and fragmentation pattern of chromatin around the periphery of the nucleus — 6c). While a similar appearance was seen in cells exposed to either 10×IC50  of JM118 (6d) or 2×IC50  of JM334 (6e), cells detaching following exposure to 10×IC50  concentration of JM334 exhibited a different morphological appearance (6f). In contrast, the chromatin was not condensed and resembled that of control untreated cells (6b). Moreover, there was evidence of extensive vesiculation in these cells. The morphological appearance of CH1cisR or SKOV-3 cells detaching after a 2 h exposure to 2×IC50  concentrations of all four compounds showed that, in each case, the detached cells exhibited the appearance of apoptotic cells. Hence, at 2×IC50  concentrations, all four compounds induced apoptosis in all three cell lines (data not shown). The results of FIGE of DNA from pooled attached and detached cells of all three cell lines exposed to 2×, 5×, or 10×IC50  of all four compounds is shown in Fig. 7  A, B for CH1 and for CH1cisR and SKOV-3, respectively. FIGE was used in preference to the detection of DNA laddering by gel electrophoresis since previous studies using these lines with cisplatin had shown that internucleosomal cleavage could not be detected in cells undergoing apoptosis [25] . The FIGE results indicate that none of the attached cell populations (lanes A3–5 for JM118, A6–8 for JM334 in CH1 cells; lanes B1 and 2 for CH1cisR JM118 and JM334, respectively and lanes B3 and 4 for SKOV3, JM118 and JM334, respectively) revealed any DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis. In contrast, all the detached cell populations of cell lines following exposure to the cis  platinum compounds JM118 (lanes A9–11 for CH1; B5 for CH1cisR and B9 for SKOV-3) and JM149 (B7 for CH1cisR and B11 for SKOV-3) revealed the presence of a fragment approximately 50 kb in size. For the detached cell populations exposed to the trans  compounds, the observed fragmentation was concentration dependent. At low (2×IC50 ) concentrations the 50 kb fragment was apparent in all cases (lane A12 for JM334 in CH1 cells, lane B6 and 8 for JM334 and JM335, respectively in CH1cisR and lane B10 and 12 for JM334 and JM335, respectively in SKOV-3). However, at the high (10×IC50 ) concentration of JM334 in the CH1 cells (lane A14) the 50 kb fragment seen at lower drug concentrations was not present.  3.5 Induction of P53 protein by cis  and trans  platinum compounds Our studies have shown that the CH1 cell lines are wild type in terms of p53 status, while the SKOV-3 is null [28,29] . Therefore, in order to the study the induction of p53 following DNA damage induced by the cis  and trans  platinum compounds, and the possible correlation to the apoptosis observed above, the CH1 and CH1cisR cell lines were selected for study. Representative results for the CH1 cell line using the JM149/JM335 pair of isomers (similar results were observed with CH1cisR) are shown in Fig. 8  A and B. Results indicate that, following 2 h drug exposure at 2×IC50  concentrations, p53 was induced by 5 h and levels remained high at 16 and 24 h post exposure. The degree of induction was somewhat higher with the trans  compound JM335 compared to its cis  counterpart.   4 Discussion In recent years within the platinum drug development field there has been a burgeoning interest in trans  platinum complexes exemplified by the discovery of active trans  platinum complexes by at least three independent Groups. Within our collaboration with the Johnson Matthey technology Company, we previously described some of the antitumor and pharmacological properties of the JM mixed amine class of trans  platinum compounds exemplified by JM335 [16–20] . These studies showed that JM335 was capable of circumventing acquired cisplatin resistance in vitro. Furthermore, JM335 produced growth delays in excess of 15 days against four human ovarian xenografts in vivo. In contrast the platinum(II) trans  counterpart JM334 was not active in vivo probably as a result of high reactivity/poor pharmacokinetic properties [17] . The underlying reasons for the promising in vitro potency of JM335 against cisplatin-resistant human tumour cell lines has not been fully elucidated, however, and has been further addressed herein. This study describes a comparison of the cellular effects of two pairs of cis  and trans  platinum isomers in an intrinsically cisplatin resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line (SKOV-3) versus a pair of ovarian cell lines (CH1 and a subline possessing acquired resistance to cisplatin), in terms of growth inhibition, drug uptake, binding to DNA, gene-specific DNA repair and induction of cell death. A notable feature of the growth inhibition studies was the improved circumvention of both acquired and intrinsic cisplatin resistance by the two trans  compounds when compared to their cis  counterparts. This interesting effect was most prominent in the SKOV-3 cell line where the level of cross-resistance (compared to the CH1 parent line) to the cis  compounds (including cisplatin) was greater than 10-fold but was only around 4-fold for the two trans  compounds. The relative potency of the trans  Pt compounds against the SKOV-3 cells is surprising in terms of the relative levels of glutathione in the CH1 versus the SKOV-3 cell line (GSH levels are 3-fold higher in SKOV-3 [30] ) and combined with the previous observation that the trans  compound JM335 is much more susceptible to inactivation by intracellular GSH than its cis  counterpart [16] . The explanation for the promising selective activity of the trans  compounds against the intrinsically cisplatin resistant SKOV-3 appears to lie at the level of DNA binding and repair. The most striking difference between the cell lines and the trans versus cis  compounds was how the SKOV-3 cell line handled DNA damage induced by the compounds at the level of gene-specific repair. Whereas this line was able to remove adducts from a fragment of the N-ras  gene within 24 h formed by both cis  platinum compounds JM118 and JM149, there was an increase in measured adducts following exposure to their trans  counterparts, JM334 and JM335. In addition, there was a small increase in overall DNA platination observed immediately following a 2 h drug exposure for the two trans  compounds relative to their cis  counterparts in the SKOV-3 cell line. Interestingly, total intracellular platinum accumulation measurements made immediately after 2 h drug exposure did not correlate with either the potencies observed in the growth inhibition studies or the levels of binding to DNA. In particular, the trans  Pt(II) compound JM334 was rapidly taken up into cells resulting in significantly higher intracellular platinum levels at 2 h drug exposure in all three cell lines but this was not reflected in significantly higher DNA platination, especially in the CH1 and CH1cisR cell lines. This is probably due to the high reactivity of JM334 [17]  resulting in avid binding to cytoplasmic thiol-containing species. While the SKOV-3 cell line appeared to discriminate at the level of gene specific repair between adducts formed by cis versus trans  platinum compounds, the CH1 appeared repair-deficient in not being capable of removing adducts from the N-ras  gene formed by any of the compounds. This repair deficiency probably contributes to the relative sensitivity of the CH1 cell line compared to SKOV-3 to all four compounds and underlines the possible importance of gene-specific repair in determining the cytotoxicity of platinum compounds. The CH1 line has also been shown to be unable to remove adducts formed by JM216 (unpublished observations). These observations support those of others using cisplatin who have correlated increased gene specific repair, especially of interstrand cross-links, with resistance of human ovarian cancer cell lines [31–34] . Levels of platinum bound to DNA were similar in the CH1 versus CH1cisR line following exposure to both pairs of compounds and no differences could be measured between the lines in terms of gene specific repair, induction of apoptosis and induction of p53 protein. Hence, as with resistance to JM216 in the acquired JM216 resistant subline of CH1 [35] , increased tolerance to platinum–DNA adducts appears to represent a major mechanism of resistance to these cis  and trans  compounds in CH1cisR. All four platinum compounds induced cell death by apoptosis in the three lines studied. The presence of apoptotic cells following drug exposure was confirmed by both fluorescence microscopy and by DNA fragmentation into 50 kb fragments. As observed previously using cisplatin in these three cell lines [25]  DNA fragmentation into internucleosomal DNA ladders was not observed in apoptotic cells. One notable difference between the cis  and trans  platinum compounds was in the kinetics of apoptosis. As observed previously with CH1 cells exposed to JM335 and JM149 [20]  apoptosis occurred markedly faster in CH1cisR cells exposed to JM334 or JM335 when compared to their respective cis  isomers. Interestingly, JM334 induced a non-apoptotic death at high drug concentrations with cells neither displaying apoptotic morphology (extensive vesiculation occurring) nor a 50 kb fragment by FIGE. In the two CH1 cell lines possessing wild-type p53, this protein was induced following exposure to either JM149 or JM335, the induction being somewhat greater with the trans  isomer. However, p53 induction was not essential for apoptosis at least in the SKOV-3 cells which is null for p53 but where apoptosis clearly occurred. In terms of the cell cycle response to the compounds, all induced a general slowdown in S-phase and effects similar to those reported previously by us in these lines using cisplatin [25]  (data not shown). These cellular data provide further evidence previously obtained at the level of DNA binding with these compounds [16,18]  and other trans  compounds [13–15,36,37]  that trans  compounds all behave differently to cis -oriented platinum compounds. For example, we showed that JM335 formed DNA adducts in cells which were not recognised by a monoclonal antibody raised against DNA platinated by cisplatin (adducts induced by JM149 and JM 118 were recognised) [18] . Also, while JM335 was capable of forming DNA interstrand cross-links in SKOV-3 cells, in CH1 cells, unusually for platinum complexes, DNA single strand breaks were detected [16,18] . The trans  iminoethers have been shown to preferentially form monofunctional adducts at guanine residues when incubated in cell-free conditions with doublestranded DNA causing unique local distortions in DNA [13–15,36] . The trans -pyridine complexes resulted in greatly increased DNA–DNA interstrand cross-linking and conformational changes shown by increased unwinding of supercoiled DNA [37] . Another trans  compound (PtCl2 (NH3 )(quinoline)) has also recently been shown to form more interstrand cross-links than transplatin when incubated with DNA for 48 h [38] . In summary, these data, along with our previous studies, indicate that the trans  platinum complexes JM334 and JM335 possess unique cellular pharmacological properties in comparison to their cis  counterparts. While all four compounds studied induced apoptosis in all three cell lines, the kinetics of cell death were faster for the trans  compounds. Their selective potency against the intrinsically cisplatin resistant SKOV-3 cell line appears to be due mainly to a slower rate of removal or even a failure to remove the DNA adducts at the level of actively transcribed genes.
