  DNA topoisomerases are the enzymes which regulate the state of DNA topology. The enzymes are,  therefore, important for DNA metabolism, such as replication, recombination and transcription) Nidulalin  A(1)2 and its derivatives, F390B(2) and C(3), were isolated from Penicillium sp. as potent cytotoxic agents  (Figure 1).3 Nidulalin A, a major metabolite of the producing strain, showed potent inhibitory activity against  DNA topoisomerase II(Topo II) in vitro.4 The antitumor activity of nidulalin A against Colon 26 routine  adenocarcinoma was evaluated in vivo, however, no antitumor effect was observed. Further investigation  revealed that rapid hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the methyl ester moiety of 1 by esterases in murine  plasma gave an inactive xanthone derivative 4, which was identical to the compound derived from 1 by  alkaline hydrolysis. This result prompted us to synthesize stable analogs against hydrolysis. In this  communication, we report synthesis and antitumor activity of derivatives of nidulalin A with amide moieties in  place of the methoxycarbonyl group.

Lett. 9 (1999) 2653-2656    Synthesis  The syntheses of amide analogs of nidulalin A are outlined in Scheme 1. Direct amidation by  methylamine in MeOH afforded approximately 4:3 mixture of lactams 10a and 10b via Michael addition  followed by intramolecular aminolysis(Scheme 2). To avoid lactam formation, nidulalin A was reduced by  NaBH4 in MeOH to give a tetrahydroxanthone derivative 5 in 87% yield,5 which was treated with 1N NaOH  followed by acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine to give carboxylic acid 6. Condensation of 6 with  various amines, including ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, 2-aminoethanol, and pyrrolidine, via acid  chloride followed by acetylation of a hydroxyl group, which was generated during amine treatment, gave  corresponding amides 7a-e, respectively. Oxidation of 7a with SeOz in dioxane at 65 gave a  dihydroxanthone derivative 8a in 18% yield. In the same manner, 7h-e were converted to 8h-e, respectively.  The acetyl groups of 8a-e were removed by alkaline hydrolysis to give amide analogs 9a-e, respectively.6    Scheme 1  H~a  "Me,"~ b'c "M~-O~.

The inactive compound 4  was not detected by HPLC analyses, and it was revealed that the amide analogs were stable against esterases]  The biological activities of the semisynthetic compounds of nidulalin A are shown in Table 1. The amide  derivatives 9a-e retained cytotoxic activity against both human and murine cancer cell lines in vitro. 9a  inhibited Topo II in dose dependent manner with IC~0 value of 29gM. Furthermore, 9a possessed weak  inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I(Topo I) with ICs0 value of 631.tM. In spite of decreased activity  against Topo II, cytotoxicity of 9a was comparable to that of 1. Lactam 10a inhibited neither Topo I nor  Topo II since a conjugated dienone moiety was required for inhibitory activity against Topo II.4 The  reason for the discrepancy between cytotoxicity and inhibitory activity against Topo I and Topo II of these  compounds is not clear. There might be other mechanisms for cytotoxicity of these analogs or instability of  1 in cell culture might decrease its cytotoxicity.    Table 1.

From above results,  it is demonstrated that the methoxycarbonyl group    modified nidulalin A analogs are stable against esterases and effective in murine tumor model in vivo. Further  evaluation of antitumor activity and synthesis of other stable analogs are underway.
