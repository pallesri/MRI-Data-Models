INTRODUCTION  Chemical substitution of ribosomal proteins by dansyl chloride [I] and  iodoacetamide [2] has yielded first results concerning the localisation of  proteins in rat liver ribosomes. The accessibility of proteins can be further  Abbreviations: MAI, methyl acetimidate; NPA, p-nitrophenyl acetate; TEA, triethanol-  amine.    310    studied by substitution of their amino groups by NPA or by MAI as will be  demonstrated in this paper. These new results agree in general with those ob-  tained earlier, but give more precise data as to the localisation of proteins in  the ribosomal subunit.    MATERIAL AND METHODS    [~4C]MAI was prepared immediately before use according to Hunter and  Ludwig [3] using [~4C] acetonitrile (1.85 mCi/mmole; Institute for Isotopes,  Budapest). [3H]NPA, synthesized as described elsewhere [4] was a gift from  Dr. B. Mehlis.  Preparation of ribosomal subunits  Polysomes isolated from rat livers according to Noll et al. [5] were in-  cubated in 500 mM KCI, 50 mM TEA HC1, pH 7.8, 1.5 mM MgC12, 5 mM  fi-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM puromycin for 30 min at 0 and then for  10 min at 37 [6]. The ribosomal subunits were separated according to  Eikenberry et al. [7] and pelleted after dilution of the gradient fractions  with 2 vol. of 50 mM TEA HC1, pH 7.8, 30 mM MgC12. Thereafter the sub-  units were dialysed against a buffer of 50 mM TEA HC1, pH 7.8, 50 mM  KC1 and 5 mM MgC12 (buffer A) and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at  10 000 g.  Isolation of proteins of ribosomal subunits  To the solution of ribosomal subunits (5 mg/ml) 1/3 vol. of 1 N HC1 was  added [8], the RNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 10 000 g  and the supernatant dialysed against 50 mM KC1, 50 mM TEA HC1, pH 7.8,  1 mM MgC12, 4 M urea (buffer B).  Substitution of proteins or ribosomal subunits by [~4C]methyl acetimidate  To 3 mg of total ribosomal protein mixture in 1 ml buffer B or to 5 mg  ribosomal subunits in 1 ml buffer A, 3 pmoles MAI were added and incu-  bated for 30 min at 37. Thereafter 4 M NH4C1 was added to give a final  concentration of 50 mM. The proteins were isolated as described and dial-  ysed against 6 M urea, 5 mM methylamine acetate, pH 5.0, 5 mM fi-mercap-  toethanol.  A label of 4.9 10s dpm with an average error of + 10% was counted per  mg protein of the small ribosomal subunit after dialysis against 0.1 M sodium  acetate (pH 5.5) and solubilization in a hyamine hydroxide containing scin-  tillation mixture as described below. Protein was estimated by the Lowry  method using ribosomal protein as a standard. The labelling value corre-  sponds to 2.4 acetimidoyl groups per 20 000 daltons which is the mean  molecular weight of the proteins of the small ribosomal subunit (see also ref.  5). For the proteins of the large ribosomal subunit 3.9 acetimidoyl groups  per 20 000 daltons were calculated.  Substitution of proteins or ribosomal subunits by [3 H]p-nitrophenyl acetate  The substitution was performed using 1.5 pmoles NPA (10 mCi/mmole)    311    per 1.0 ml by incubation for 60 min at 37 in analogy to the reaction de-  scribed before. The excess of reagent was destroyed by incubation with 0.25  N HC1 for 1 h at 0.

[9]. The gel slabs were stained with 0.0005% Coo-  massie Brillant Blue G 250 in 3% trichloroacetic acid for 24 h. Thereafter the  gel pieces containing the stained proteins were cut and their staining intensi-  ties measured in 10 mm glass cuvettes at 578 nm. For the estimation of the  labelling the gel pieces were squashed using a 1 ml syringe with a I mm  aperture and incubated for 16 h with 1 ml of 0.5 N hyamine hydroxide  (Packard Instruments, Ill.) in toluene. The counting efficiency against an ex-  ternal standard was about 80% using a scintillation mixture with 0.4% 2,5-  diphenyloxazole, 0.01% 1,4-bis-(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl)benzene, 10% Triton X-  100, 0.3% acetic acid in toluene. After measuring the label for 10 min the disin-  tegrations per min (dpm) were correlated for each spot to 1.0 A s78. The average  values of 5--10 independent experiments are given in Tables I and II. The  average errors of the mean values not specified for the individual proteins did  not exceed 10%.    RESULTS    MAI reacts exclusively with the amino groups of proteins [3], whereas  NPA also substitutes tyrosine and cysteine residues [10]. Because of the  relatively high lysine content, the low portion of tyrosine and cysteine in  ribosomal proteins of rat liver [11] and the lower reactivity of tyrosine OH-  groups [12], it can be expected that both reagents predominantly react with  amino groups.  The substitution of ribosomal protein mixtures by both reagents is com-  pleted after 30 min at 37 to more than 90%. The proteins isolated from  the small ribosomal subunit incorporate on the average 1,7-acetyl and 2,4-  acetimidoyl groups, respectively, per 20 000 dalton, and the proteins of the  large subunit bind 3,9-acetimidoyl groups per 20 000 dalton.  The labelling values for the proteins of the small subunit are presented in  Table I. The values for labelling of the protein mixture with NPA vary from  10 600 to 37 100 dpm per 1.0 As78. When using the subunits, values between  2700 and 23 700 dpm per 1.0 AsTa are measured. It is obvious from these  results that the reactive groups of the proteins in the subunit structure are  only available to about 10 to 65%. 28 proteins can be classified into 3 groups  with 10--22%, 23--30% and 31--66% remaining reactivity: Proteins $9, 14,  19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28 and 30 {marked by--) are strongly protected, the  reactivity of 9 other proteins is diminished moderately ($1, 5, 13, 16, 17,  18, 21, 26 and 29 (marked by +), and the proteins $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12,  15, 22 and 27 (marked by +) are exposed to a relatively high extent.  The reaction of proteins with MAI in the small ribosomal subunit is on the  average only little decreased in comparison to the free proteins. As demon-  strated in Table I, the reactivity of proteins $4, 11, 12, 14, 21, 24, 25, 27  and 29 (marked by --} is inhibited by 30% or more if the subunit is com-    315    pared with the protein mixture. The proteins $5, 7, 10 and 16 (marked  by + } are labelled more strongly in the subunit than in the isolated protein  mixture, showing values of more than 130%. For 11 proteins (S1, 2, 8, 9, 13,  15, 18, 19, 20, 22 and 26; marked by -+), the labelling is about the same both  in the subunit and in the protein mixture {70--130%}.  A stronger inhibition of the reaction of MAI with proteins is observed in  the large ribosomal subunit (Table II). On the average a value of 30% is es-  timated in comparison ta the protein mixture. Proteins L2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19,  22, 31 and 32 (marked by --) in the subunit structure take up only 20% or  even less of the label taken up by the isolated protein mixture. When la-  belled in the subunit a second group of proteins (L4, 7, 20, 21, 27, 28, 35  and 36; marked by +) show 21--28% and a third group {L5, 6, 13, 15, 17;  23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 33, 34 and 38; marked by +)more than 29% of the  label of the protein mixture.    DISCUSSION    Chemical substitutions of ribosomal proteins by iodoacetate and 2-  methoxy-5-nitrotropone [13], fluorescein isothiocyanate [14], acetanhy-  dride [15], iodine [16,17], 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitro-benzoic acid) [18], N-  ethyl-maleimide and iodoacetamide [19], aldehydes [20] and kethoxal [21]  have been successfully used to elucidate the topography of proteins in ribo-  somal subunits of E. coli.  As was demonstrated before, all proteins organized in the ribosomal sub-  units of rat liver are accessible to the reaction with MAI and with NPA. The  extent of reaction, however, is less than with the isolated protein mixture.  Both findings are in good agreement with results obtained with iodoacet-  amide [2], 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone [22] and also with conclusions drawn  from iodination experiments [23].  When comparing experiments with MAI and NPA it is remarkable that the  reactivity to NPA of the proteins organized in the small ribosomal subunit is  inhibited more strongly than the reactivity to MAI in comparison to the free  protein mixture. This may be due to the less hydrophilic properties of NPA  which prevent this reagent from penetrating the ribosomal subunit structure  as readily as the more hydrophilic MAI obviously can.  The reaction of the proteins in the small ribosomal subunit to MAI, on the  whole, occurs more readily than those in the large ribosomal subunit in com-  parison to the corresponding free protein mixtures. This finding favours a  more dense structure of the large ribosomal subunit. The explanation that  more reactive protein groups are localized on the surface of the small ribo-  somal subunit in comparison to their total number than in the large ribo-  somal subunit is unlikely, because the reaction of small and large subunit  proteins with NPA is inhibited to the same extent in the subunit structures.  Different proportions of reactive amino groups in small and large ribosomal  subunits from E. coli have also been reported by Slobin [24] using methyl  picolinimidate.    316    If the proteins are classified as weakly exposed (--), moderately exposed  (-+) and strongly exposed (+) proteins, it can be demonstrated that the re-  sults obtained with different reagents agree for the preponderantly buried  proteins $14, 25, L8, 10, 11, 19, 31 and 32 and for the mainly exposed pro-  teins L15, 17, 25, 29, 33, 34 and 38 (see Table III). For the other proteins  also listed in Table III, the results obtained with different reagents are not in  full agreement. However, the accessibility of proteins in the subunit struc-  ture to trypsin [25] and their tendency to be split from the subunits by dif-  ferent LiC1 concentrations [26] argue in favour of a relatively buried locali-  zation of the proteins $9, 19, 20, 24, 27, 29, 30, L1, 7 and 28 and an ex-  posed arrangement of the proteins $2,5, 7, 8, 10, 13, L20, 24, 27 and 35.  Exposed positions were also reported for proteins moving electrophoreti-  cally like L17, 24 and 29 by Reboud, studying the reaction of large subunits  of rat liver ribosomes with 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone and glutaraldehyde  [ 22 ], respectively.
