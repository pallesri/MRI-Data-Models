 Cholinesterases have been extensively studied for several years. They have two known actions: acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) plays a key role in the nervous system where it terminates the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine, and, when present in non-cholinergic contexts, as is for example vertebrate butyrylcholinesterase, (EC 3.1.1.8) they are believed to metabolise xenobiotics. These enzymes have two distinct substrate binding sites: the catalytic site which lies at the bottom of a 20 Å-deep gorge and a peripheral site composed of numerous aromatic residues lining the active site gorge [1,2] . The catalytic site can be divided into two subsites, the esteratic site represented by Ser200 which is activated by a catalytic triad and the catalytic anionic site represented by Trp84 which participates in the recognising the positively charged choline part of the substrate. Very efficient metabolization of acyl esters by cholinesterases takes place at the bottom of the gorge. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine which is nearly as fast as allowed by diffusion [3,4]  proceeds in three steps: the reversible formation of a Michaelian complex, followed by the acylation and subsequently by the deacetylation of Ser200 [5] . As substrate also binds to the peripheral site, different forms of the enzyme will exist depending on which sites are occupied. In the insect enzyme, hydrolysis of the substrate deviates from Michaelian behaviour, with activation at low substrate concentration and inhibition at high concentration [6] . To describe this activity, we recently tested various kinetic models by fitting and finally proposed a putative scheme able to explain all our data sets (Scheme 1   simplified in Scheme 2  ). It supports a secondary substrate binding site on the protein distinct from the catalytic site. Binding to the catalytic site located at the bottom of the gorge seems to be irreversible, suggesting that each molecule of substrate which enters the active site gorge is metabolised. Reversible binding at the peripheral site is high affinity in the free enzyme (4 μM), suggesting that this increases the probability of the substrate entering the active site gorge. Active site occupation then leads to a decrease in peripheral site affinity (30 mM). Peripheral site occupation decreases the rate constant for a entrance of the second substrate molecule into the catalytic site and strongly affects the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This results in both an apparent activation at low substrate concentration and a general inhibition at high substrate concentration. Certain reversible inhibitors bind to all enzymatic forms while others bind only to some of them, such as the free or the acylated enzyme. When binding occurs at the catalytic site, the acetyl–enzyme–inhibitor complex usually deacetylates at a slower rate than the free acetyl-enzyme [7,8]  while ligand binding at the peripheral site modulates activity [9,10]  by destabilising of substrate binding at the catalytic site [11]  through conformational changes [12] . Each inhibitor may occupy a distinct position and be oriented somewhat differently at the two anionic sites as evidenced by kinetics [13] , in vitro mutagenesis [14]  and structural data [15] . Here, we test the proposed kinetic model for insect AChE using three reversible inhibitors: tetramethylammonium (TMA), edrophonium and choline. The model suggests that TMA binds to two sites on the protein including the catalytic site, while edrophonium and choline bind only to one site.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 AChE synthesis and purification Drosophila  AChE was produced in baculovirus infected cells, purified and stabilized according to Estrada and Fournier [16] . Briefly, a hydrophilic protein was produced by cloning a cDNA truncated at the 3′ end encoding an hydrophobic peptide exchanged to a glycolipid anchor. The AChE was secreted in the culture medium and purified by affinity chromatography followed by diafiltration and anion exchange chromatography to eliminate copurified proteases. As drosophila AChE was not stable when diluted, bovine serum albumine was added to the sample to 1 mg/ml.  2.2 Kinetics of substrate hydrolysis Kinetic analysis was performed at 25°C in 25 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.25. Hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide was followed at 412 nm using the method of Ellman et al. [17] , with substrate concentrations of 1 μM to 200 mM. Reversible inhibitions were tested from 0.25 to 80 mM for TMA, from 1 to 100 μM for edrophonium and from 0.01 to 10 mM for choline.  2.3 Data analysis Initial rate constants obtained in the presence of inhibitor at various concentrations were analysed according to the mechanistic models previously described [18]  considering that the inhibitor molecule can bind to a peripheral site and/or to the catalytic site. The corresponding rate equations were derived and fitted simultaneously to the complete set of data for each inhibitor. Among the models tested corresponding to the different binding possibilities, we chose the simplest one which fitted all data. Indeed, it was found, in each inhibition mechanism, that not all the reaction steps were necessary, so in the analysis of kinetic data, were left out. For each inhibitor all the kinetic constants valid in the presence of the substrate were determined. Their evaluations were carried out by means of a non-linear regression program [19]  and according to general criteria for the goodness of fit [20] .   3 Results and discussion Scheme 1  presents a putative model allowing the analysis the kinetic data of insect AChE. However, some of the eight kinetic parameters proved to be unstable and thus were not evaluated correctly. Therefore, the three-step model was reduced to a two- step model [21] . Several simplifications are possible. One possibility is to combine acylation and deacylation into a single rate constant [22] . Although this simplified model is useful and currently used [23] , it can only explain biphasic kinetics with either activation or inhibition and so cannot be used to explain our experimental data unless it is extended to three binding sites for the substrate. Two other simplifications resulting in the same equation were operative for all our experimental data, obtained with different mutated enzymes and in different experimental conditions. In the first simplification, we assume that each molecule which enters the active site gorge is metabolised and thus that ES complex formation is an irreversible step [24,25]  (Scheme 2 ). In the second simplification, reversible Michaelian complex formation and acylation are included in the same step, the scheme remains identical to Scheme 2  with EA instead of ES. In the presence of a reversible inhibitor, hydrolysis can be described by Scheme 3   assuming that two binding sites exist for the substrate and the inhibitor on the protein (the catalytic site and a peripheral site). From this scheme, the kinetic steady-state rate equation was derived:(1) v E t   =k3  S    1+a S    K4   +c I    K7      k3  ki     1+a S    K4   +c I    K7      1+ S    K3   + I    K6   + I    K1   + S    I    K2 K3   + I   2  K5 K6       1+b S    K3   +d I    K6       + S    1+ S    K4   + I    K7           The values of all relevant kinetic constants are presented in Scheme 4   and in graphical form along with the corresponding experimental data in Fig. 1  . The analysis of experimental data obtained in the presence of TMA, edrophonium or choline was performed by fitting to all data simultaneously for each inhibitor. In each case, Eq. (1)  fits the experimental results well. Meanwhile, for choline and edrophonium, experimental data can be resolved by a simplified scheme using only 10 parameters. In each case all parameters were estimated without constraint. It turned out that the values of the six parameters corresponding to the reaction without inhibitor did not significantly change if the analysis included the data from acetylcholinesterase inhibition. For edrophonium and choline, the complex IEI is not necessary to describe data, suggesting that there is only one binding site on the enzyme. The binding is non- competitive for the peripheral site. In addition, the complex EIS, resulting from the binding of an inhibitor molecule to ES, is necessary to correctly fit the kinetic data. This suggests that the inhibitor molecule binds at the catalytic site even if it is occupied. In that case, the second simplification is operative and ES is replaced by EA in Schemes 2–4 . Kinetic and structural data obtained for vertebrate AChE are in accordance with this binding at the catalytic site [15,26] . In a second hypothesis, the inhibitor can bind to the enzymatic form ES, suggesting that it binds on a peripheral site different from that of the substrate. Following the two hypothesis, the inhibitor binding to the protein prevents the substrate becoming positionned at the catalytic site and decreases the acylation and/or the deacylation step (c =0.14 and 0.23 for choline and edrophonium respectively). For TMA, the total Scheme 3  must be used since all simplifications tested resulted in a decrease of the correlation coefficient. As the IEI species was useful to describe data, it seems that the TMA competes with the substrate at the peripheral and the catalytic sites. Such a result is not in agreement with previous reports suggesting that TMA binds to a single site on the vertebrate enzyme [27,28]  but could be related to the enzyme origin which shows more complex kinetics with substrate activation and inhibition. In contrast to the substrate, TMA binding at the peripheral site does not hinder the entrance of the substrate molecule into the gorge (d =1) since it is a smaller molecule than the substrate. Analysis of constants obtained without inhibitors (Scheme 2 ) suggests that binding of the substrate at the peripheral site decreases the rate constant of substrate entrance into the active site gorge (123/21 μM−1  s−1 ), and decreases substrate hydrolysis (995/6.7 s−1 ). For inhibitors, the same relation was observed: peripheral site occupation by a substrate molecule decreases the affinity of the inhibitor at the catalytic site (K 2  is always greater than K 1 ). The effect, however, depends on the inhibitor: it is strong with choline but weaker with edrophonium and TMA. This interplay between the two sites is in accordance with other studies which also showed that peripheral site occupation by a substrate molecule modulates the activity of the enzyme by destabilization of substrate at the catalytic site [9–11,2,12,29] . Destabilization seems to originate from conformational changes-a movement of the Ω loop-hich modifies the orientation of a main element of the catalytic site, Trp84 [30,31] . In conclusion, this study shows that the simple model which was proposed for the reaction between Drosophila  AChE and its substrate is also able to describe kinetics with the simultaneous action of the substrate and a reversible inhibitor.
