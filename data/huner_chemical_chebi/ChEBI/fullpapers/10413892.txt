    Human fascioliasis, caused by Fasciola hepatica, is a  great worldwide health problem (CHEN & MOTT, 1990;    ESTEBAN et al., 1998e). Several areas have been de-  scribed as presenting true human endemics, ranging  from low to very high prevalences and intensities  (MAS-COMA al., 1999a). Studies carried out in recent  years have demonstrated that the most important human  fascioliasis endemic regions are located in South America  (MAS-COMAetfl/., 1995, 1999a; WHO, 1995;HlLLYER  & APT, 1997; ESTEBAN et al., 1998e).    Coprological (MAS-COMA al., 1995; ESTEBAN al.,  1997a, 1997b) and immunological surveys (HILLYER et  al., 1992; BJORLAND et al., 1995; MAS-COMA et al.,  1995; O'NEILL et al., 1998), concerning either a given  locality or only a very few, have shown that the Northern  Bolivian Altiplano, between Lake Titicaca and the valley  of the city of La Paz, presents high human prevalences  and intensities.    Concerning the intermediate snail host involved,  despite initial reports of 2 different lymnaeid transmit-  ting species (Lymnaea matrix and L. cubensis) in the  Bolivian Altiplano (UENO et al., 1975), it has been  recently demonstrated that only 1 transmitting species  is there. Shell morphology and visceral mass anatomy  (OVIEDO et al., 1995), and molecular (BARGUES & MAS-  COMA, 1997; BARGUES et al., 1997) and isoenzyme  (JABBOUR-ZAHAB et al., 1997) studies have proved that  this species is the European L. truncatula, most probably  introduced by Spanish colonizers long ago.    Investigations carried out in the Northern Bolivian  Altiplano have shown that there are different animal  species which play the role of reservoirs and others that  are potential definitive hosts (UENO & MORALES, 1973;    UENO et al., 1975; MAS-COMA et al., 1995, 1997;    HILLYER et al., 1996; BUCHON et al., 1997; FUENTES  et al., 1997; GROCK et al., 1998). Sheep may be consid-  ered the most important reservoir (GROCK et al., 1998),  followed by cattle (BUCHON et al., 1997). Pigs and  donkeys represent effective secondary reservoir hosts of  the parasite in this area and must also be taken into  account within preventive and control measures (MAS-    Address for correspondence: Professor Dr Jose-Guillermo  Esteban, Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Pharmacy,  University of Valencia, Av.

Horses, goats, llamas and alpacas, as  well as rabbits, hares and rodents, do not participate in  the transmission (FUENTES et al., 1997; MAS-COMA et  al., 1997).    The aim of this paper is to present and analyse the  results obtained in 31 coprological surveys including  different Altiplanic localities. The purpose is to obtain a  general overview of human infection prevalences and  intensities throughout the endemic zone. This is the first  time that such a large epidemiological study of a human  fascioliasis area has been carried out.    Materials and Methods    This study was conducted in the Department of La  Paz, Bolivia, and more specifically in a region of the  Northern Bolivian Altiplano, between Lake Titicaca and  the valley of the city of La Paz, at a very high altitude  (3800-4200 m) (Figure). The surface area and human  population characteristics of this zone have already been  summarized m a balantidiasis study concerning the same  area (ESTEBAN etal., 1998b).    A total of 31 coprological surveys were carried out in  24 localities over the 6-year period 1992-97 (Table 1).  These surveys involved 2723 Aymara subjects (1483  males, 1240 females) aged 1-100 years (mean SD,  10-9 7-5 years), among whom were 2521 students  (1350 boys, 1171 girls) aged 5 to 19 years (9-6 -7  years) from the schools of these 24 localities. These  surveys were carried out so that the sample size in each  school was representative of both the student enrolment  in the school (at least 50%) and the number of children  present on the day of the survey (at least 75%). In  Chijipata Alto and Huacullani, where high prevalences  in the schools were detected, surveys were extended to  total inhabitants and involved 202 subjects (133 males,  69 females) aged 1 to 100 years (26-7 0-1 years).  Surveys were performed so that the sample size was  always at least 20% of the subject number of each  locality. None of the children that participated in these  community surveys was included in the school surveys of  the same localities. All the surveys were made on  randomly selected persons on a given day among all  participating subjects.    One stool sample per subject was collected from all  participating individuals and personal data (name, sex,  and age) were noted. The relatively low receptivity of  Aymara adults, related to their ethnic and religious  characteristics (ESTEBAN et al., 1998b), made it impos-  sible to obtain multiple stool specimens collected at 2- or    132    JOSE-GUILLERMO ESTEBAN ETAL.

Each stool sample was examined using  the Kato-Katz technique (KATZ et al., 1972) for hel-  minth eggs and, if possible, direct and concentration  MIF (SAPERO & LAWLESS, 1953; BLAGG et al., 1955),  formol-ether concentration (KNIGHT et al., 1976), and  modified Ziehl-Neelsen (HENRIKSEN & POHLENZ,  1981) techniques were applied in order to cover all the  protozoan spectrum.    Statistical analyses were done using SPSS 6.1 (SPSS  Institute, Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Statistical  comparison of categorical variables was carried out with  X2 or Fisher's exact tests. Normally distributed data were  analysed using Student's t-test and analysis of variance  (ANOVA). Mann-Whitney utest and Kruskal-Wallis  test (Jf) were used for non-normally distributed data.  Prevalences and intensities m the same schoolchildren  studied in different years were compared with McNemar  and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, respectively. Values of  P < 0-05 were taken as significant.    This study was conducted with the agreement of the  Secretaria Nacional de Salud del Ministerio de Desar-  rollo Humano (La Paz, Bolivia) and was performed in  collaboration with the INLASA Institute in La Paz. All  investigations were made with the consent of the subjects  or, in the case of young children, their guardians.    Results    Prevalences    The total prevalence of fascioliasis in the 2723 subjects  studied was 15-4%. The maximum prevalences in the  school and community surveys were obtained in Chiji-  pata Alto (68-2% and 65-4%, respectively in 1996),  whereas in some other school surveys F. hepatica infec-  tion was not even detected (Table 1). Significant differ-  ences between prevalence rates both among combined  school surveys and among combined community surveys  (P = 0-0001 by Fisher's exact test, and x2=312,  P = 0-0001, respectively) were detected.    Comparison analysis of prevalence rates detected in  the surveys carried out in the same school (i.e., Acha-  cachi, Chijipata Alto and Huacullani) or in the same  community (i.e., Huacullani) in different years showed  no statistical differences. Moreover, no statistical differ-  ences were detected between prevalences among the  same schoolchildren analysed in different years.    Discrepancies in the results were, however, observed  when comparing the total prevalences (including the  different years) obtained in the school and community  surveys in the same locality: in Chijipata Alto no signifi-  cant difference was observed (60-5% in the 2 combined  school surveys vs. 65-4% in the community), whereas in  Huacullani (33-8% for the 3 combined school surveys vs.  16-5% for the 2 combined community surveys) a signifi-  cant difference was detected (%2 = 19-06, P = 0-0001).  Similar results were obtained when comparing the pre-  valences obtained in the school survey and the commu-  nity survey in the same locality carried out in the same  year 1996: in Chijipata Alto there was no significant  difference (68-2% in the school vs. 65-4% in the com-  munity), whereas in Huacullani (34-8% in the school vs.  18-4% in the community) a significant difference was  detected (/2 = 8-89, P = 0-0029).    The distribution of prevalences according to sex and  age-groups in the school surveys and also in the com-  munity surveys is shown in Table 2. In relation to sex, a  significant difference was detected neither among  schools, nor among communities, and a similar result  was obtained when considering the total of the subjects  studied in all the surveys.    In the school surveys, the distribution of prevalences  according to age-groups did show significant differences  Cy2 = 19-00, P = 0-0001) when comparing age-groups  established according to school criteria: age 5-8 years,  basic level, 9-12 years, intermediate; 13-19 years,  medium level and students still in school but eligible  for military service.

In the community surveys,  significant differences (/2 = 14-5, P = 0-0023) were also  detected, with highest prevalences in the age-groups 1 -  10 years (29-3%) and 11-20 years (43-8%) (Table 2).    Intensities    Intensity of infection, measured as epg by the Kato-  Katz technique, in school and community surveys is  shown in Table 1. Absolute egg counts in the total  individuals surveyed with detectable infection ranged  from 24 to 5064 epg, with arithmetic and geometric  means of 446 and 191 epg, respectively. Significant  differences were detected among the different school  surveys (.H = 51-82, P = 0-0005) as well as among the  different community surveys  = 12-66, P = 0-0018).    Comparison analysis of intensities detected in school  surveys carried out in different years in the same locality  did not show statistical differences in the case of Chiji-  pata Alto, but it did in that of Huacullani (F = 4-80,  P = 0-009). In the latter, however, no significant differ-  ence was detected between the results obtained in the 2  community surveys. No significant differences were  detected between intensities among the same school-  children analysed in different years.    When comparing the intensity values obtained in the  school and community surveys in the same locality, the  combined results showed significant differences between  the school and the community in Chijipata Alto  (= 229-5, P = 0-0123) but not between the school  and the community in Huacullani. Similar results were  obtained when comparing the intensity values obtained  in the school survey and community survey carried out in  a given locality in the same year: significant differences in  Chijipata Alto ((7=75-0, P = 0-0472), but not in  Huacullani.    Intensities according to sex and age-groups in the  school and community surveys are shown in Table 2. No  significant differences according to sex were detected in  the total study and in the community surveys, but the  significantly higher F. hepatica egg counts for the girls in  the school surveys (t = 2-59, P = 0-010) is worth men-  tioning. The analyses according to age-groups did not  show any significant difference.    Discussion    The prevalences and intensities obtained by coprolo-  gical methods in this study are the highest known up to  the present. These results are even more noteworthy  when taking into consideration the fact that the localities  surveyed in the Northern Bolivian Altiplano were se-  lected only because of their geographical situation, in  order to cover a wide geographical area. The probability  of detecting high infection rates of fascioliasis was not  taken into account and thus survey efforts were not  concentrated on the subzones presenting the highest  human fascioliasis rates. Owing to the important clinical  and pathogenic effects of fascioliasis (CHEN & MOTT,  1990; MAS-COMA et al., 1999a, m press), the analyses of  prevalences and intensities obtained allow us to conclude  that the Northern Bolivian Altiplano must be catalogued  as a true human fascioliasis endemic area. The term  outbreak sometimes used for this area (BJORLAND et al.,  1995) may consequently be used only when a temporary  prevalence increase in a given Altiplanic locality is  detected.    Differences detected between the results of the pre-  valences obtained in different localities are not related to  different seasons and may be linked to the patchy  distribution of the transmission foci, marked by the  presence of the necessary freshwater lymnaeids, as well  as to the Aymara children's tendency not to travel far.  The lack of seasonality in the prevalences detected  contrasts with the well-known seasonal transmission  characteristics of fascioliasis in other parts of the world.  This may be explained by the absence of marked climatic  differences between the different seasons in the Northern  Altiplano.    The non-significant differences in prevalences by sex  and the fact that all ages are susceptible to infection  (positive cases from 2 to 70 years), despite the fact that  the subjects aged <20 years are those with a higher  infection risk, could be explained by the lack of gender  role differences and by the ingestion of several aquatic  vegetables (MAS-COMAeta/., 1995) as a risk factor for F.  hepatica infection. These results agree with a few studies  performed in areas of Egypt (FARAG et al., 1979), Peru  (KNOBLOCH et al., 1985; SCHEZ et al., 1993) and  Chile (APT et al., 1993).    The very high egg counts are worth noting when  compared with the epg normally found to date in human  fascioliasis diagnosis: 1-4 epg (BENDEZet al., 1982;    KNOBLOCH et al., 1985) is the most common; a case with  440 epg (AKAHANE et al., 1975) may be considered as  rare. However, the prospective study by SAMPAIO SILVA  (1990) provided a geometric mean (range) of 233 (25-  2100) epg, which was the highest epg count known up to  our study.    With the exception of a few localities, the distribution  of intensities corresponds to the distribution of preva-  lences, and the scarce disagreements in some localities  may be explained by the few children coming from the  very few surrounding zones including transmission foci.    Intensity results obtained in schools and communities  surveyed more than once, in different seasons and  throughout different years, as well as those obtained in  the school and community surveys in the same locality  are difficult to interpret.    Similarly, the significantly higher F. hepatica egg  counts for the girls in the school surveys are surprising.  Concerning intensity in humans, a relationship between  the number of fluke adults and eggs in faeces has never  been studied. Data from animals suggest that a direct  relation does not necessarily exist (CHEN & MOTT,  1990). It is evident that further studies on this aspect  are needed.    Intensity data according to age-groups show that egg  output counts decrease with an increase of age. In 3  persons aged >60 years, egg counts of 24-168 epg were  found. Consequently, adult subjects either maintain the  parasites acquired when young or can be newly infected    HUMAN FASCIOLIASIS IN BOLIVIA    155    as the consequence of inhabiting a zone of high infection  risk. A case of a 2-year-old child shedding 48 epg is worth  mentioning, as it is the youngest human fascioliasis case  reported so far.    The human health problem of this distomatosis in the  Northern Bolivian Altiplano is related to the hygienic-  sanitation status of the human population. The numer-  ous different protozoan and helminth species detected in  the area surveyed and the multiple parasite infections  detected, including F. hepatica infection, in the same  subjects (ESTEBAN et al., 1996, 1997a; 1998a, 1998b)  are illustrative of this situation.
