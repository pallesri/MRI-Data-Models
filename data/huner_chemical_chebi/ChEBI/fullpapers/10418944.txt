 Cancer in various forms is one of the leading causes of death in the human population. Chemoprevention and chemotherapy are employed in reducing human mortality due to cancer or in the control of cancer. There are several natural products of plant origin (phytochemicals) that are of potential value as chemopreventive or therapeutic agents. As therapeutic agents, the phytochemicals kill the cancer cells or stop their growth, leading to cancer remission. Some of the new cancer chemotherapeutic agents derived from plants in current clinical use are paclitaxel (Taxol), vincristine (Oncovin), podophyllotoxin and captothecin (Pezutto, 1997 ). A screening test using human cancer cell lines is usually performed as an initial step in the evaluation of chemicals for cancer prevention and treatment (Skehan et al., 1990 ). Those compounds that are found to be potent in killing cancer cells or inhibiting cell growth are then further screened for their ability to suppress the growth of tumours in animal models. One group of compounds with potential antitumour activities are flavonoids, which are either synthetic or natural constituents of foods or drink (tea and fruit juices) consumed by humans. Flavonoids are composed of different chemical classes such as flavones (7,8-benzoflavone or α -naphthoflavone), isoflavones (genistein), flavonols (quercetin), flavanols [(+)-catechin], flavanones (naringenin) and chalcones (xanthohumol). These compounds differ in the level of oxidation of the flavane nucleus and in the number and position of hydroxyl and methoxyl substituents (Lee et al., 1994 ). Flavanones lack the double bond in the 2,3-position of the C ring present in the flavane nucleus. Opening of the C-ring of naringenin yields the chalcone, chalconaringenin. Chalcones are open C-ring flavonoids in which the two aromatic rings are joined by a three-carbon α ,β -unsaturated carbonyl system (Bohm, 1994 ). Chalcones are converted to flavanones chemically by treatment of the former with sodium acetate in methanolic solution or enzymatically by chalcone isomerase (Stevens et al. 1997, 1998 ). Flavonoids, including chalcones and flavanones, have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and inhibit tumour growth (Anto et al., 1995 ; De Vincenzo et al., 1995 ; Middleton and Kandaswami, 1994 ; Satomi, 1993 ; Seo et al., 1997 ; Wattenberg et al., 1994 ; Yit and Das, 1994 ). The biological effects of the chalcones depend on their chemical structure. For example, methyl and hydroxy substituted chalcones are cytotoxic in Ehrlich ascites cells and Dalton's lymphoma ascites cells, whereas only hydroxy substituted chalcones reduce ascites tumours in mice (Anto et al., 1995 ). Of several chalcones studied, 3′-methyl-3-hydroxy-chalcone showed the strongest antitumour and antitumour-promoting activity (Nishino et al., 1993 ; Satomi, 1993 ; Shibata, 1994 ). This compound was found to inhibit the proliferation of various kinds of human malignant tumour cells representing gastric cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma (Satomi, 1993 ). Thus, substitutions on the chalcone structure have a profound influence on the anticarcinogenic effects of chalcone compounds. Recently, six chalcones (xanthohumol, 2′,4′,6′,4-tetrahydroxy-3′-prenylchalcone, 2′,4′,6′,4-tetrahydroxy-3′-geranylchalcone, 5′-prenylxanthohumol, dehydrocycloxanthohumol and dehydrocycloxanthohumol hydrate) and three flavanones (isoxanthohumol, 6-prenylnaringenin and 8-prenylnaringenin) have been isolated from hops by Stevens et al. (1997) . Four of the hop flavonoids with prenyl groups (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, 6-prenylnaringenin and 8-prenylnaringenin) are found in hopped beers (Stevens et al. 1998, 1999 ). Xanthohumol is the most abundant prenylated flavonoid in hops whereas isoxanthohumol is the most abundant flavonoid in all types of beer tested (Stevens et al., 1998 , 1999). Isoxanthohumol in beer is produced by the isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process (Stevens et al., 1999 ). The potential of the major prenylated hop compounds, xanthohumol and isoxanthohumol, as antineoplastic agents is not known. Other prenylated flavonoids display cytotoxic activity against several human cancer cell lines (Seo et al., 1997 ). It is possible that the prenylated flavonoids from hops and beer may have the ability to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells, making them potentially useful as cancer chemopreventive agents. Thus, the objective of this research project was to examine the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of prenylated flavonoids from hops (Humulus lupulus ) in human breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer (HT-29) and ovarian cancer (A-2780) cells in vitro . The cytotoxicity of these hop compounds in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes was also evaluated in an effort to determine their potential to cause liver toxicity in the intact animal. Hepatic toxicity is one of the early issues that need to be addressed in drug development and is therefore pertinent in our investigation on the overall evaluation of hop flavonoids as potential preventive agents for cancer in humans.  2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Chemicals The chalcone compounds (Fig. 1  ) tested for their growth-inhibitory activities were xanthohumol (XN), 2′,4′,6′,4-tetrahydroxy-3′-prenylchalcone (TP), 2′,4′,6′,4-tetrahydroxy-3′-geranylchalcone (TG), dehydrocycloxanthohumol (DX), and dehydrocycloxanthohumol hydrate (DH). The other chalcone, 5′-prenylxanthohumol, isolated from hops was not available in sufficient quantities for this study. Isoxanthohumol (IX), a flavanone derivative of XN which is present in hops (Stevens et al., 1997 ), was also examined for its antiproliferative activity for comparative purposes. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). Culture media and supplements were purchased from Gibco BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). Collagenase (Type 2) was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corporation (Freehold, NJ). [Methyl -3 H]thymidine (25 μ Ci/μ mol) was purchased from Amersham (Arlington Heights, IL, USA).  2.2 Cell cultures Three established human cancer cell lines [oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7), human colon cancer cells (HT-29) and human ovarian cancer cells (A-2780)] were used for the cytotoxicity studies. These cell lines (except A-2780) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD, USA). The ovarian cancer cell line, A-2780, was generously provided by Dr Raymond Taetle, MD, Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ.  2.3 Sulforhodamine assay The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, developed by the National Cancer Institute for in vitro  antitumour screening (Rubinstein et al., 1990 ; Skehan et al., 1990 ), was employed to determine the relative potencies of the individual hop compounds in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells and in determining the differential sensitivities of three human cancer cell lines to the antiproliferative effects of the individual flavonoids. The SRB assay measures whole-culture protein content as an index of tumour cell viability. Experimental cell cultures were plated on a 96-well microtitre plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA), with each well containing 0.2 ml growth medium per well at a density of 5×103  cells/well. After 1 or 2 days of incubation at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 , the cells (30–40% confluent) were exposed to culture medium containing the hop flavonoids at varying concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 μ m ). The flavonoids were initially dissolved in ethanol before being added to the culture media. Vehicle-treated controls contained ethanol at the same concentration (0.1%) as in the treated media. The culture medium was phenol red-free RPMI (for HT-29 and A-2780) or Ham's F-12/DMEM (FD) (for MCF-7) supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum (FBS) plus penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μ g/ml). The cell doubling times in these media were 38, 30 and 48 hr for MCF-7, HT-29 and A-2780 cells, respectively. 2, 4 or 6 days following incubation with the test materials or ethanol (control cultures), the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were fixed by gentle addition of 200 μ l cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The control cells were in the proliferative stage during the 6-day period and were semiconfluent or 100% confluent after 6 days. The plates were incubated for 1 hr at 4°C and then washed five times with tap water to remove TCA. Plates were air-dried and then stained for 30 min with 0.4% (w/v) SRB dissolved in 1% acetic acid. SRB was removed and cultures were quickly rinsed four times with 1% acetic acid to remove unbound dye. Residual wash solution was removed and the cultures were air-dried. The bound dye was then solubilized with 200 μ l 10 mm  unbuffered Tris base (pH 10.5). The absorbance of each well at 564 nm was read in a SpectraMax 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA). At day zero (day of treatment), the readings of the control wells in the 96-well plates ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 OD. The antiproliferative activity was calculated from the ratio of the absorbance readings of the treated wells to those of the control wells. Vehicle-treated control cells were grown in four wells in every 96-well plate used. For every cell line, all the flavonoids were tested simultaneously at the designated times to avoid day-to-day variation. At each time period, intra-assay (plate to plate) variation in vehicle-treated cells was minimal as shown by standard errors of 4% or less from three individual plates. For example, the absorbance reading (mean±SEM) of vehicle-treated control cells in three plates (four wells per plate) after 2 days of treatment of MCF-7 cells was 1.53±0.03. The average of four wells per treatment was used for the calculation of the IC50  (the concentration of flavonoid resulting in a 50% inhibition of cell growth) using the Data Analysis and Technical Graphics software (Origin 5.0) from Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA, USA.  2.4 Effects of XN and IX on viability of MCF-7 cells determined by the trypan blue exclusion method MCF-7 cells (50,000 cells/well) were seeded into 12-well plates (Corning) in a final volume of 1 ml phenol red-free Ham's F-12/DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 hr in culture, the cells were treated with XN or IX at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 and 100 μ m  in FD medium containing 5% FBS. Control cells were incubated under identical conditions in 1 ml culture medium containing 0.1% ethanol. After 8, 24 and 48 hr of treatment, the cells were trypsinized and cells were counted in a haemacytometer using the trypan blue exclusion method to quantify cell viability. To determine population doubling time, untreated cells were counted in a haemacytometer after incubation in FD medium containing 5% FBS for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. The cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities of XN and IX on MCF-7 cells were determined by using the method described by Jain et al. (1997)  as follows: Antiproliferative activity    =(Viable cells control  −Viable cells treated  ) Viable cells control    ×100       Cytotoxicity    =% cell viability control  −% cell viability treated  ) % cell viability control    ×100        2.5 Effects of XN and IX on DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells MCF-7 cells (5000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates (Corning) in a final volume of 0.2 ml phenol red-free FD medium containing 10% FBS. After a 24-hr incubation, the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of XN or IX in FD medium containing 5% FBS. Control cells were incubated in FD medium containing 0.1% ethanol. After 1, 2 and 4 days, the cells were washed once with phenol-red free FD medium and then incubated with 0.2 ml of [methyl -3 H]thymidine (1 μ Ci/well) for 3 hr. The medium was removed and the cells were fixed by incubation in 10% TCA for 1 hr at 4°C. The cells were then washed twice with 10% TCA to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were air-dried and the cells were lysed with 1 n  NaOH (0.2 ml/well). A 0.1-ml aliquot of the lysate was neutralized with HCl prior to the addition of scintillation fluid (Opti-Fluor). The radioactivity of the samples was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT, USA). The counts (disintegrations per min) of four wells in each treatment were averaged and expressed as percent of controls (ethanol-treated cells).  2.6 Agarose gel analysis of DNA fragmentation This experiment was performed to determine whether XN and IX induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells using the DNA fragmentation assay on agarose gels. Semiconfluent MCF-7 cells growing in 12-well plates were incubated in FD medium containing 5% FBS and different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 40 and 100 μ m ) of XN or IX. Control wells contained 0.1% ethanol instead of flavonoids. After 8 or 24 hr of incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 , the test media were collected in microfuge tubes and 200 μ l lysis buffer (DNAzol Reagent, Gibco/BRL) was added to each well. The tubes containing the test media were centrifuged at 10,000 g   for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and 50 μ l lysis buffer was added to each tube. For each sample, the lysate from the wells was combined with lysate in the microfuge tube. Absolute ethanol (150 μ l) was added to each tube containing the combined lysate to precipitate the DNA. The DNA was spooled with a pipette tip and attached to the wall near the top of the tube. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and the DNA remaining in the tube was washed with 0.5 ml of 95% ethanol. The DNA was air-dried, dissolved in 100 μ l sterile water and an aliquot was used for DNA estimation from the absorbance reading at 260 nm. The isolated DNA (6 μ g) was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide for 1.5 hr in TAE buffer (40 mm  Tris-acetate and 1 mm  EDTA, pH 8). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, then destained in water containing RNAse A and viewed on a UV transilluminator. Photos were taken using a digital camera attached to a computer with a video processor (UVP Image Store 7500, Ultra Violet Products, Upland, CA, USA).  2.7 Preparation and treatment of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were obtained from 8–11-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats using a procedure originally described by Acosta et al. (1980) . The liver was perfused by retrograde perfusion of the portal vein with a modified Hanks’ calcium-free balanced salt solution containing collagenase Type II (80 U/ml). The pellet (hepatocytes), obtained after several steps of mechanical dissociation and low-speed centrifugation of the tissue homogenates, was resuspended in Williams’ medium E containing 0.001% (w/v) insulin, 0.005% (w/v) hydrocortisone, 10% (v/v) newborn bovine serum, potassium penicillin G (200 U/ml) streptomycin sulfate (200 μ g/ml), and amphotericin B (4 μ g/ml). The cell suspension was strained through a sterile nylon strainer (100 μ m) into a 50-ml centrifuge tube. Cell viability was greater than 95% as determined with the trypan blue dye exclusion test. The cell suspension was diluted to 1.0×106  cells/ml and transferred to 24-well plates at 0.5 ml/well. Hepatocyte cultures were grown in a CO2  incubator with 95% air and 5% CO2  at 37°C and maintained at a pH of 7.2–7.4. At 24 hr from the initial plating, the culture plate was shaken in a circular motion, cell debris was removed and culture medium was replaced with fresh medium. The incubation medium was changed every 24 hr. Hepatocytes were grown in culture to near confluence for 2 days prior to treatment with the hop flavonoids. The primary hepatocyte cultures were exposed to the flavonoids (in ethanol) at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1.0, 10 or 100 μ m  (only XN and IX were used at the highest concentration). The final concentration of ethanol in the incubation medium was 0.1%, which did not affect the viability of the hepatocytes. Control incubations contained ethanol (0.1%). Untreated cells (no ethanol) were also incubated to help assess the effect of ethanol itself on the viability of the hepatocytes. After 1, 6, 24 and 48 hr of incubation, aliquots of the cell supernatants (after centrifugation) were analysed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using a Sigma diagnostic kit (Cat. No. 500) in a 96-well microplate reader (SpectraMax 250, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Enzyme activity was expressed as units/ml of culture medium.  2.8 Statistical analysis Statistical significance was determined by Student's t -test. In all cases, P  values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.   3 Results 3.1 Sulforhodamine assay The SRB assay is an indirect measure of cell density or number of live cells attached to the culture plate (Skehan et al., 1990 ). As shown by Skehan et al. (1990) , the SRB results are linear with the number of viable cells and protein content in the wells at densities from sparse subconfluence to multilayered supraconfluence. In agreement with these results, we found that dead cells detached from the plate and were removed with the culture media during the SRB assay. Microscopic examination of the individual wells of the culture plate showed this detachment of dead cells. The antiproliferative activity was then measured as a ratio of the number of viable cells (expressed as OD units) in flavonoid-treated wells and in ethanol (vehicle)-treated wells. Cytotoxicity was inferred from the SRB assay by comparing the OD units of the wells with flavonoid-treated cells at designated times after treatment with those wells with untreated cells at day zero (cells in plates before treatment with flavonoid or ethanol). Lower OD readings after 2, 4 or 6 days of treatment compared with OD readings at day zero indicate occurrence of cell death or cytotoxicity, instead of growth inhibition or antiproliferative activity. With this method, our results showed that cell death occurred in the MCF-7, HT-29 and A-2780 cells treated with any of the hop flavonoids when used at 100 μ m  concentration (data not shown). Cytotoxicity of the flavonoids at this concentration was verified by microscopic examination of the 96-well plates. Fig. 2   shows the dose–response relationship of the five chalcones and one flavanone (IX) with the growth (as percent of control) of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) after a 2-day (A) or 4-day (B) period of treatment. At 0.1 and 1.0 μ m , only DX caused a significant inhibition of growth of breast cancer cells after 2 days of exposure (Fig. 2 A). At 10 μ m , XN was most growth-inhibitory followed by DX, IX and TG in that order. At 100 μ m , all the flavonoids except TP almost completely inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells. A greater inhibition of growth of breast cancer cells was obtained with 10 μ m  XN, DX and IX at 4 days (Fig. 2 B) than at 2 days of exposure and XN was the most active flavonoid. At 100 μ m , all the flavonoids almost completely inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells after 4 days of treatment (Fig. 2 B). The effects of the hop flavonoids on growth of human colon cancer cells (HT-29) are shown in Fig. 3  . Unlike MCF-7 cells, the growth of human colon cancer cells (HT-29) was only slightly inhibited (less than 11% inhibition) at 10 μ m  of XN and DX after 2 days of treatment (Fig. 3 A). Approximately 8–12% of the HT-29 cells exposed to 100 μ m  TP, DH and IX survived after 2 days of treatment. After 4 days of treatment of colon cancer cells, flavonoids did not inhibit cell growth at 10 μ m  or lower concentration. However, all the flavonoids almost completely inhibited cell growth at 100 μ m  (Fig. 3 B). The response of ovarian cancer cells (A-2780) to the antiproliferative activity of hop flavonoids is depicted in Fig. 4  . The growth of these cancer cells was significantly inhibited by all the flavonoids at 10 μ m  and by XN, TP and TG at 1 μ m  after 2 days of treatment (Fig. 4 A). Significant inhibition of cell growth was observed even at 0.1 for TP and TG. At 100 μ m , all the flavonoids were highly toxic to the cells. After 4 days, none of the flavonoids (at 0.1, 1 or 10 μ m ), except XN (10 μ m ), inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 4 B) but at 100 μ m , all the flavonoids almost completely inhibited their growth. An expanded range of doses (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 100 μ m ) was then used to further evaluate the relative growth-inhibitory activity of XN, DX and IX in A-2780 and MCF-7 cells by calculating and comparing their IC50  values. These three flavonoids were chosen for further evaluation because they differed widely in their ability to inhibit growth of A-2780 and MCF-7 cells. The dose–response curve revealed that the antiproliferative activity of XN at 10 μ m  or greater was similar at 2, 4 and 6 days in human ovarian cancer cells (A-2780) (Fig. 5  ). However, at lower concentrations, the growth-inhibitory activity of XN to A-2780 cells decreased with time of exposure. The calculated IC50  of XN at 2, 4 and 6 days of exposure were 0.52, 5.2 and 6.7 μ m , respectively. Similarly to XN, DX and IX also displayed lower IC50  values in A-2780 cells at 2 days than at 4 days of treatment (Table 1  ). However, in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), the flavonoids (XN, DX and IX) were more inhibitory (lower IC50 ) at 4 days than at 2 days of treatment (Table 1 ). XN was more effective than DX or IX in inhibiting the growth of MCF-7 cells at both times of exposure.  3.2 Antiproliferative effects of XN and IX on MCF-7 cells as determined by cell counting using the trypan blue exclusion method Another method to determine the antiproliferative activities of XN and IX on MCF-7 cells is to use a haemacytometer to count the number of viable cells remaining after the designated treatment period. Using this cell counting method, it was determined that XN and IX, at 0.01 to 10 μ m , did not affect the proliferation of MCF-7 cells after 8 hr of treatment (Fig. 6  A). However, at 100 μ m , both flavonoids significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells during the same period. After 1 day of treatment, XN significantly inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, from 0.01 to 100 μ m  (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, IX was only inhibitory at 100 μ m . After 2 days, growth inhibition induced by XN became more pronounced (Fig. 6 C). IX became inhibitory at 10 μ m , and at 100 μ m , both XN and IX produced a complete inhibition of cell growth. The population doubling of untreated MCF-7 cells in FD medium containing 5% FBS was estimated to be 1.3 days.  3.3 Cytotoxic effects of XN and IX on MCF-7 cells as determined by cell counting using the trypan blue exclusion method Cytotoxicity of XN and IX in MCF-7 cells was investigated using the trypan blue exclusion method. Neither XN nor IX, at 0.01–10 μ m , produced cytotoxicity in these cells after 8 hr of treatment (Fig. 7  A). At 100 μ m , these two flavonoids were toxic to MCF-7 cells. After 24 hr, XN but not IX was slightly toxic at 10 μ m  (Fig. 7 B). When the treatment period was increased to 2 days, XN became slightly toxic to MCF-7 cells at 0.01 μ m  or higher (Fig. 7 C). At this time, 10 μ m  IX showed significant toxicity to MCF-7 cells. At 100 μ m  XN or IX, virtually all the cells were killed after 2 days of exposure. Microscopic examination showed that most of the dead cells were in the culture media, not attached to the culture plate.  3.4 Effects of XN and IX on DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells The effects of XN and IX on DNA synthesis, as determined by [3 H]thymidine incorporation into MCF-7 cells, are shown in Fig. 8  . Both XN and IX caused a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis after one day of treatment (Fig. 8 A). XN inhibited [3 H]thymidine incorporation at much lower concentrations than IX. The doses at which a significant decrease in [3 H]thymidine incorporation was initially observed were 0.5 μ m  for XN and 5 μ m  for IX. A similar pattern of inhibition of DNA synthesis was obtained after 2 days of exposure (Fig. 8 B). However, after 4 days, IX was more effective than XN in inhibiting thymidine incorporation at 5 μ m  or lower (Fig. 8 C). At 10 and 20 μ m , XN was more inhibitory than IX. XN caused an unusual pattern of inhibition of thymidine incorporation into MCF-7 cells in that a significant inhibition was observed at 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 10 and 20 μ m  but not at 1 or 2.5 μ m . The degree of inhibitory effect of XN at 5 and 10 μ m  was relatively greater at 2 days than at 4 days of treatment.  3.5 Agarose gel analysis of DNA fragmentation One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the production of characteristic DNA fragments when the DNA is cleaved by Ca++ -dependent endonucleases at the linker sites between nucleosomes (Arends and Wyllie, 1991 ). The ultimate DNA fragments are multimers of 180-bp fragments that resolve into a “DNA ladder” during electrophoresis on agarose gels. Neither XN nor IX at 10, 40 or 100 μ m  induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in MCF-7 cells after 8 (Plate I A) or 24 hr (Plate I B)  of treatment.  3.6 Toxicity of hop flavonoids in rat hepatocyte cultures The toxicity of XN, TP, TG, DH and IX in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium. Cell viability was not significantly affected by the flavonoids at 10 μ m  or lower after 24 hr of treatment (Fig. 9  ) or after 1, 6 or 48 hr of treatment (data not shown). At 100 μ m , XN and IX were highly toxic to the hepatocytes. The toxicity of TP, TG and DH at 100 μ m  was not evaluated because of insufficient supply of these flavonoids at the time of the study. For the same reason, no toxicity data from the rat hepatocyte studies for DX could be presented in this report. Additional preliminary studies showed that the five hop flavonoids do not inhibit mitochondrial respiration and do not uncouple oxidative phoshorylation in isolated rat liver mitochondria at 10 μ m  or lower (R.J. Rodriguez, C.L. Miranda, J.F. Stevens, M.L. Deinzer and D.R. Buhler, unpublished observations).   4 Discussion Previous studies have shown that certain synthesized or naturally-occurring chalcone compounds (not found in hops) exhibit antiproliferative activities in human cancer cell lines (De Mello et al., 1974 ; Ramanathan et al., 1993 ; Satomi, 1993 ; Yit and Das, 1994 ). The potency of the chalcones (butein, 2′-hydroxychalcone, 2-hydroxychalcone, 2′,6′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxychalcone and 2′,4-dihydroxychalcone) as inhibitors of growth of human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, CCL 220.1, was dependent on the position and number of hydroxyl groups in the chalcone nucleus (Yit and Das, 1994 ). In both primary and established ovarian cancer cells, the presence of an α -β  double bond, the hydroxylation at the 2 or 3 position of ring B and the absence of a prenyl group were important to the antiproliferative activity of chalcones (De Vincenzo et al., 1995 ). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether chalcone compounds found in hops have antiproliferative effects in certain human cancer cell lines. The results of the present study using the sulforhodamine assay showed that of the five hop chalcones tested, XN was the most effective antiproliferative agent in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), colon cancer cells (HT-29) and ovarian cancer cells (A-2780). IX was the least effective inhibitor of growth of A-2780 cells whereas TP and DH were least active in MCF-7 cells. Of the three cell lines studied, A-2780 was more sensitive than MCF-7 cells to the antiproliferative activities of all five hop flavonoids tested. The differential activity of the chalcones tested in this study can be ascribed to the nature and position of substituents in the chalcone molecule. The presence of a methoxy group (in XN), instead of a hydroxyl group (in TP) at the 6′ position in the A ring, appeared to increase the growth inhibitory activity of the chalcone for MCF-7 (Fig. 2 ) and HT-29 (Fig. 3 ) cells but not for A-2780 cells (Fig. 4 ). Substitution of the prenyl group with a geranyl group at the 3′ position (TP to TG) resulted in reduced growth of A-2780 but not of MCF-7 cells. The addition of a hydroxyl group to DX, as in DH, decreased the antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 cells, but not in A-2780 cells. Conversion of a chalcone to a flavanone (XN to IX) also resulted in reduced antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 and A-2780 cells. IX is a trace component of hops but is the most abundant flavonoid in hopped beer as a result of the isomerization of XN during the brewing process (Stevens et al., 1999 ). The ovarian cancer cell line (A-2780) was more sensitive than the colon and breast cancer cell lines to the toxic effects of XN, TP and TG after 2 days of exposure. In A-2780 cells, these chalcones were cytotoxic at concentrations as low as 0.1 μ m . However, a 4-day treatment with TP or TG at concentrations up to 10 μ m  did not inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth. Furthermore, the IC50  of XN increased from 0.5 μ m  at 2 days to 5.2 μ m  at 4 days in A-2780 cells. The increase in IC50  values in these cells at 4 days was also observed with DX and IX. These results suggest that the ovarian cancer cells became less sensitive to the hop flavonoids with increased length of exposure. There are several possibilities that may explain the decreased sensitivity of the ovarian cancer cells with increased length of exposure. The loss of antiproliferative activity of the hop flavonoids in A-2780 cells could be attributed to detoxification of the flavonoids by the ovarian cancer cells. During the 4-day exposure, the culture medium was not replaced with fresh medium containing the flavonoids. The concentration of the flavonoids or their inhibitory metabolites may have decreased over time in the incubation medium due to detoxification or non-enzymatic degradation. Nielsen et al. (1998)  have found that rat P450 enzymes are capable of hydroxylating and demethylating flavanones, flavones or flavonols. Preliminary studies in our laboratory showed that cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of XN in rat liver microsomes (unpublished data), and it is possible that the human cancer cells can detoxify the hop flavonoids. Studies on the metabolic transformation of hop flavonoids by the human cancer cell lines may help explain the differential sensitivity of the three human cancer cells to these compounds. In particular, these metabolism studies may explain why the hop chalcones were not potent in inhibiting the growth of colon cancer cells (HT-29) despite previous studies showing that other chalcones are highly effective as antiproliferative agents in colon cancer cells (Yit and Das, 1994 ). It has been demonstrated that multidrug resistant A2780 cells can be obtained by exposure of the cells to drugs that are substrates for the P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux (Chu et al., 1994 ). Thus, after 4 days, the A-2780 cells, as well as HT-29, may have higher levels of expression of P-glycoprotein that would act as an efflux pump to move XN out of the cells, making the cells resistant to the flavonoids. However, certain prenylated flavonoids have been shown to inactivate the P-glycoprotein by bifunctional interactions at vicinal ATP and steroid-binding sites of the protein (Conseil et al., 1998 ). If the hop flavonoids block the action of this protein, then they should still be growth-inhibitory after 4 days in A-2780 and HT-29 cells. Studies on the interaction of the hop flavonoids with P-glycoprotein are needed to further understand the mechanism for the development of resistance of cancer cells to hop flavonoids with increased length of exposure. To further differentiate the antiproliferative activity from the cytotoxicity of XN and IX in MCF-7 cells, another experiment using 12-well plates was performed in which dead and viable cells in each well were counted in a haemacytometer after trypan blue exclusion staining. Cells attached to the plate and in the culture medium were counted at time zero (before addition of flavonoids) and at various times (8, 24 and 48 hr) after treatment. The results indicate that XN inhibited cell growth after 24 or 48 hr at concentrations from 0.01 to 10 μ m  but caused little or no toxicity (cell death) to the cells (Figs. 6 and 7 ). IX was growth-inhibitory at 10 μ m  after 48 hr of treatment. However, both XN and IX inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells by more than 50% after 8 hr of exposure and by more than 90% or greater after 24 and 48 hr. The antiproliferative activity of XN and IX at 100 μ m  after 8 hr was not completely attributed to the cytotoxic effects of these flavonoids at this concentration since percent viability was greater than 60% at this time. After 24 and 48 hr, the antiproliferative activity of XN and IX at 100 μ m  was almost completely due to cell killing, not inhibition of cell division. The same explanation could be offered for the effects of other flavonoids used at 100 μ m  in the three human cancer cell lines since the number of viable cells (based on sulforhodamine assay and microscopic examination of cell cultures) remaining after treatment was less than that obtained before treatment at time zero as stated above. Inhibition of DNA synthesis may be one of the mechanisms by which XN and IX exert their antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 8 , XN and IX caused a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis (as measured by [3 H]thymidine incorporation) in MCF-7 cells after 1, 2 and 4 days of treatment. After 4 days, XN was surprisingly less active than IX at 5 μ m  or lower in inhibiting thymidine incorporation. This finding was not consistent with the greater inhibition of cell growth by XN than IX (Fig. 2  and Table 1 ). Therefore, there must be other mechanisms to explain the differential antiproliferative activity of XN and IX in MCF-7 cells. The isoflavone genistein induces cytotoxicity and growth inhibition in several cancer cell lines by inhibition of DNA synthesis, protein tyrosine kinases, inhibition of DNA topoisomerases, inhibition of cell cycle events, and induction of apoptosis (Barnes et al., 1995 ). The synthetic flavone flavopiridol induces also growth arrest and apoptosis in leukaemia cells (Konig et al., 1997 ). Consequently, it is possible that hop flavonoids may cause growth arrest at more than one stage of the cell cycle. Certain prenylated chalcones have been shown to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (Pharmar et al., 1997 ). Therefore, apoptosis may be one of the mechanisms by which hop flavonoids such as XN and IX cause cell death in MCF-7 cells. However, our preliminary work showed that treatment with XN and IX for 8 or 24 hr did not induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells based on the DNA laddering assay on agarose gels (Plate Plate I ). Additional studies using other methods to assay apoptosis (in situ  TdT labelling, morphological examination and flow cytometric analysis) are needed to confirm that XN and IX do not induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. The potential of XN as anti-neoplastic agent for breast cancer can be evaluated further by comparing its ability to inhibit growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro  with that of other flavonoids such as genistein. Genistein inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells (based on SRB assay) with an estimated IC50  greater than 40 μ m  after 4 days of exposure (Hoffman, 1995 ). Shao et al. (1998)  reported an IC50  of 20 μ m  for genistein in MCF-7 cells after 6 days of treatment. In the present study, XN gave an IC50  of 3.47 μ m  in MCF-7 cells after 4 days of treatment. As an inhibitor of DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells, genistein has an IC50  of 12.6 μ m  at 2 days (Hoffman, 1995 ) whereas XN has an IC50  of 1.5 μ m  (calculated from Fig. 8 ). These observations suggest that XN is several fold more potent as an antiproliferative agent than genistein, a flavonoid currently used in clinical trials as a chemopreventive agent for breast cancer in humans. Two citrus flavanones, naringenin and hesperetin, have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of oestrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-235 and oestrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as determined by [3 H]thymidine incorporation into growing cells. After 2 days of treatment of MDA-MB-435, both flavanones gave an IC50  of 18 μ g/ml (So et al., 1996 ) whereas in MCF-7 cells, the IC50  for naringenin and hesperetin were 18 and 12 μ g/ml, respectively (So et al., 1997 ). In the present study, IX inhibited [3 H]thymidine incorporation in MCF-7 cells with an IC50  of 10 μ m  (or 3.54 μ g/ml) suggesting that the prenylated flavanone from hops and beer is more effective than the citrus flavanones as an antiproliferative agent for MCF-7 cells. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether IX will inhibit tumour growth of MCF-7 cells in nude mice. In conclusion, XN appeared to be the most potent of the five hop flavonoid tested in inhibiting the proliferation of three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HT-29 and A-2780). In particular, XN (the most abundant flavonoid in hops) was highly potent in suppressing the growth of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and ovarian cancer cells (A-2780). IX, the flavanone isomer of XN and the most abundant prenylated flavonoid in hopped beers, was also a potent inhibitor of growth of MCF-7 cells after a 4-day exposure. Inhibition of growth of MCF-7 cells by XN and IX was associated with inhibition of DNA synthesis. These findings indicate that an evaluation of the potential anticancer properties of XN and IX in the intact animal is warranted.
