 Carbohydrate structures containing a Galα1→3 Gal terminus, namely α-Gal epitope, have been identified as xenoactive antigens and are considered to be the major cause for hyperacute rejection in xenotransplantation.1–6   Similar to ABO blood-mismatched organ allotransplants, transplants from species other than Old World primates are rejected within minutes by human natural antibodies, so-called anti-Gal. The anti-Gal antibody is reported at levels of 1–2% of total IgG and 3–8% of total IgM in human blood.2   They bind specifically to an α-Gal epitope on the surface of the xenograft cells to initiate complement-mediated lysis of the cells.7   Taking advantage of this humoral response from the human body, we report the design, synthesis, and binding of α-Gal epitope containing glycoconjugates for targeting bacterial cells with naturally occurring human anti α-Gal antibodies. The feasibility of using antibody targeting followed by mediated immune response against bacterial cells was proved by Bertozzi et al.8,9   However, antibody based immunotherapy is often limited by immunogenicity. Development of humanized antibodies is a complex and difficult task. Recently the direct use of human natural antibodies such as anti-Gal for the specific deletion of target cells has become very attractive.10,11   In this paper, we chose bacterial cells as a model system. Numerous bacterial strains produce surface lectins which are in the form of fimbriae (or pili) that are filamentous appendages of protein subunits. They are found to be responsible for cell–cell recognition and infectious disease. However, many bacteria undergo genetic changes to eschew the host immune system. In spite of these changes, the binding specificity of bacterial cell-surface lectins is conserved.12   Many of the bacterial lectins exhibit distinct sugar specificities. Among the best characterized fimbrial lectins are the type 1 fimbrial lectins which are specific for α-mannosides.13,14   The binding affinity of the mannose receptor to a mannose ligand falls in the millimolar range. Recently it has been found that the avidity of carbohydrate ligands binding to proteins can be increased dramatically when carbohydrate ligands are organized as multivalent clusters.15–18   The mannose-containing glycopolymers and glycodendrimers have been reported to have ideal inhibitory effect of binding of yeast mannan to Concanavalin A and Pea lectins.19   It was indicated that the well-defined glycodendrimers were not as effective as glycopolymer. We synthesized a new type of α-Gal epitope and mannose containing glycopolymers (Fig. 1  ). Binding of such glycopolymers to mannose specific bacteria, followed by treatment with human natural anti-Gal should result in complement-mediated lysis of the bacteria. The binding of the glycopolymers to bacteria was tested for inhibition against agglutination of yeast mannan (S. cerevisiae ) to E. coli . Human natural anti-Gal antibody binding to the α-Gal containing glycopolymers was demonstrated by an ELISA inhibition assay.  Results and Discussion Preparation of monomers bearing a hydrophilic spacer from lactose and mannose Scheme 1   shows the synthesis of β-lactosyl acrylamide (5  ). We chose commercially available 2-[2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol (1  ) as a spacer building block. Complete transformation of chloride to azide 2     was accomplished in DMF at 80°C according to a known procedure.20   Glycosylation of 2   with α-lactosyl bromide heptaacetate using Köenigs–Knorr glycosylation method gave compound 3   in 82% yield. The desired β-configuration was confirmed by the coupling constant of anomeric proton (J 12 =7.8 Hz). The glycoside 3   was deacetylated by the Zemplén method to give water soluble 4   in good yield. Hydrogenation of compound 4  , followed by the treatment with acryloyl chloride to provide monomer precursor 5   in 71% yield. Scheme 2  shows a similar glycosylation approach toward the synthesis of α-mannosyl acrylamide (8   ). The glycosylation reaction provided compound 6   in moderate yield (49%). The α-configuration was determined by the anomeric proton coupling constant (J 12 =1.5 Hz) along with a characteristic feature that no carbon chemical shifts around 76 ppm (In peracetylated mannoside, C-5 chemical shift is 76 ppm for β-anomer, while 70 ppm for α-anomer). Comparing to α-lactosyl bromide heptaacetate, α-mannosyl bromide tetraacetate was more reactive. Consequently, more by-products were observed in this reaction.  Enzymatic synthesis of an α-Gal disaccharide containing monomer precursor Synthesis of Galα1→3Gal acrylamide monomer precursor 11   was accomplished by a one-pot enzymatic transglycosylation reaction catalyzed by α-galactosidase from green coffee beans (Scheme 3 ).21   Although the yield of this enzymatic reaction, like the conventional transglycosylation, is relatively low, the concise synthetic approach is still more attractive than the typical protecting-deprotecting chemical synthesis. Transformation of the nitro group of compound 9   to the N -acryloyl function was then effected by hydrogenation, followed by the treatment with acryloyl chloride in methanol to give compound 11  .  Radical terpolymerization and enzymatic preparation of glycopolymers containing lactose and mannose The glycopolymers bearing α-Gal epitope were constructed through two different routes. The first one is to use the epitope 11   to copolymerize with mannose monomer precursor 8   and acrylamide in an established terpolymerization method22   (Scheme 4 ). The polymerization was initiated by ammonium persulfate and N,N,N′,N′ -tetramethylethylenediamine in aqueous solution. Thin-layer chromatography was used to monitor the reaction. The final polymer was obtained as a white fluffy material after separation by Bio-gel P-2 permeation column and freeze-drying (76% yield). The 1 H NMR in D2 O verified the incorporation of all three monomers in the final glycopolymer 12  . We have developed an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of α-Gal epitope using a recombinant α1-3 galactosyltransferase.23   The second route is to use the recombinant enzyme to transfer a galactose from uridine 5′ diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal) to a lactosyl acceptor in a glycopolymer containing other sugar moieties such as mannose which is not an acceptor of the enzyme (Scheme 5  ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example showing the selective modification of glycopolymers bearing different sugar moieties. Similar enzymatic transformations to the polymers bearing single type of sugar ligand have been reported.24–26   In order to enhance the transfer efficiency, the biocompatible oligoethoxyl group was employed. This provided the lactosyl acceptor side chains with adequate space away from the bulky polymer main chain. The enzyme then can bind to the acceptor completely for subsequent transformation. As anticipated, the enzymatic transformation generated the modified glycopolymers 15A –B     in nearly quantitative yield (confirmed by the integration ratio of anomeric protons). It is noteworthy that all the glycopolymers obtained from terpolymerization have a high molecular weight (Mw  >870 kD) with mean hydrodynamic diameter of polymer chain in aqueous solution greater than 69 nm at ambient temperature. The choice of using aromatic 13   and non-aromatic 8  α-mannoside ligands for the glycopolymers was based on the work done by Firon et al.27,28   They found that E. coli . showed a hydrophobic region close to mannose-binding sites which favored aromatic α -mannosides such as p -nitrophenyl-α-d -mannopyranoside. They also noticed that Salmonella  species possessed a binding site which was smaller than that of E. coli ., and devoid of a hydrophobic region. The 13 C NMR spectrum of glycopolymer 15B   is shown in Figure 2 . The anomeric region is expanded and clearly shows the presence of lactose with 103.5 and 102.7 ppm, mannose with 99.1 ppm, and newly formed α-galactose anomeric carbon resonance of 96.0 ppm (Fig. 3 ).  Chemoenzymatic synthesis of monovalent α-Gal-mannose conjugate As shown in Scheme 6  , compound 19   with two single ligands of α-Gal epitope and α-mannoside was constructed for a control experiment comparing with the multivalent counterpart 15B  . Glycosylation of methyl 6-hydroxyhexanoate with α-lactosyl bromide heptaacetate using the same Köenigs–Knorr glycosylation condition as in Scheme 1  afforded compound 16  . The glycoside 16   was deacetylated by the Zemplén method, followed by saponification to give water soluble 17   with a free carboxylic group. The lactosyl derivative was then coupled with p -aminophenyl-α-d -mannopyranoside using diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) as a promoter which was demonstrated to activate glycopeptide coupling in the presence of free hydroxyl groups.29   The reaction was conducted in DMF at room temperature to give conjugate 18   in 66% yield. Enzymatic galactosylation of compound 18   using α1-3 galactosyltransferase provided the α-gal epitope containing conjugate 19  .  Binding studies of α-Gal-mannose glycoconjugates to bacteria The α-Gal-mannose glycopolymers were tested for their ability to function as multivalent ligands for the binding of E. coli  K-12 HB101 bacterial cells. This E. coli  strain contains mannose-binding sites located on the surface of the bacteria, which can bind yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), resulting in visible agglutination. To evaluate the activity of our glycopolymers 12   and 15A –B  , we compared their inhibitory effects on agglutination with several controls including the monovalent methyl-α-d -mannopyranoside, p -nitrophenyl α-d -mannopyranoside, α-Gal-mannose conjugate 19  , polyvalent mannose copolymers 15C–D . The results indicated that the glycopolymers 12   and 15A –B   are effective in preventing agglutination at concentrations as low as 100 μM. Comparing to methyl-α-d -mannopyranoside, dramatic increase in the inhibitory efficacy was observed with polyvalent mannose. However, p -nitrophenyl α-d -mannopyranoside was found to be the most potent inhibitor. This compound showed strong inhibition at concentrations as low as 90 μM. Monovalent conjugate 19   and polymer 15B   bearing a hydrophobic aromatic ring had comparable inhibitory effects. The polyvalency here is unexpectedly overshadowed by van der Waals forces resulting from the packing of the aromatic ring againt a hydrophobic binding pocket on the surface of the bacteria. It is noteworthy that no inhibition was observed with p -nitrophenyl α-d -galactopyranoside. This indicates the mannose-binding sites are highly specific. α-Gal residue is not able to compete with mannose in binding to the bacterial mannose receptors (Table 1  ).  Binding studies of α-Gal-mannose glycoconjugates to human natural anti-Gal antibodies using an ELISA inhibition assay To assess the activity of α-Gal-mannose glycoconjugates binding to the anti α-Gal antibodies, we applied a previously reported ELISA inhibition assay.30   Mouse laminin having α-Gal epitopes were fixed on ELISA plate as solid-phase antigens. Test glycoconjugates were then incubated with human anti-Gal antibodies on the ELISA plate. The plate was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. After additional washing, the color was developed by HRP reaction using a chromogenic compound. Monovalent conjugate 19   and polymer 15B   were tested with two controls α-Gal epitope (Galα1→3Galβ1→4Glc) and mannose copolymer 15D . As shown in Table 2  , conjugate 19   and polymer 15B   bind effectively to human anti-Gal antibody. The polyvalency of α-Gal epitope on polymer 15B   was clearly demonstrated by comparing the inhibition of compound 19   with polymer 15B   at the same concentration of α-Gal epitopes. Polymer 15D  without having α-Gal epitope had no binding to human anti-Gal antibody. It can be concluded that no cross reactivity exists between mannose and human natural anti-Gal antibodies. More importantly, inhibition stem from steric stabilization31   of antibody surface was not observed under our experimental conditions.  Conclusion In summary, we have used chemoenzymatic synthesis to effectively construct monovalent and multivalent α-Gal conjugates containing mannose ligands. The α-Gal and mannose containing compounds were subsequently proved to be potent inhibitors against the bindings of both yeast mannan to E. coli ., K-12 and human natural anti-Gal antibodies to mouse laminin. Cross reactivities of mannose binding to anti-Gal antibodies and α-Gal residue binding to bacteria were not observed. The model compounds with dual binding capacity will be viable ligands to redirect human natural immunity against bacterial pathogens coated with xenoactive epitopes. The sandwiched binding motif as well as bacterial killing assay will be further reported in due course.

Agglutination assays were carried out on a 9-well spot plate. Aliquots of 90 μL of a solution of the test compound were first agitated with 30 μL bacterial suspension for 30 s. After that, 30 μL yeast suspension was added, and allowed to develop with agitation for at least 3 min. Agglutination was observed under a magnifying glass.  Purification of anti-Gal IgG from human serum Polyclonal anti-Gal antibodies were isolated from the human serum according to a modified protocol as reported previously.32   Male AB type serum was heat-inactivated in a water bath at 56°C for 30 min. The α-Gal Sepharose affinity column was washed with 75 mL PBS buffer. The heat-inactivated serum (25 mL) was run over the column three times, and the flow-through collected. The column was washed with 6 mL PBS 14 times until an OD280nm  reading less than 0.01 of the flow-through was reached. The anti-Gal antibodies was eluted from the column with 5 mL of 100 mM glycine·HCl buffer (pH 2.8) 10 times until sufficiently low OD280nm  readings were obtained. The fractions were collected, neutralized immediately with 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate, and determined by ELISA assays.

Test compound (0.1 or 1 mM) was incubated with 55 μL of a PBS solution of human polyclonal anti-Gal IgG for 1 h at 37°C with slow agitation. The human anti-Gal IgG concentration used was adjusted to cause 50% of maximal binding to solid-phase antigen. ELISA plate was blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated 45 min at room temperature. To appropriate wells on ELISA plate was added 50 μL of the test compound/Ab solution. The solution in each well was incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The wells were subsequently washed with PBS/0.05% Tween and incubated with goat anti-human IgG-peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at room temperature. After additional washing with PBS/0.05%Tween, the peroxidase reaction was performed with 100 μL of a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)/H2 O2  (9 1   ) solution, and the UV absorbance was measured at 655 nm.
