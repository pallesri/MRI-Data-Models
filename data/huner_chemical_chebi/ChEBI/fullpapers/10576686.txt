  The protein mediator known as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has emerged to play a  central role in the control of the host inflammatory and immune response. Described originally as a lymphocyte  "activity" responsible for inhibiting the random migration of macrophages in vitro,l'z MIF has been shown to be  released from the anterior pituitary gland during stress and to be critically involved in the toxic response to  septic shock.3 Macrophages, T cells, and eosinophils release MIF in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, and  the expression of MIF is required for T-cell activation and antibody production by B cells.4'5 More recent studies  have shown that macrophages and T cells can secrete MIF in response to glucocorticoid stimulation, and that  once released, MIF can "override" the immuno-suppressive effects of steroids on cytokine production and  cellular activation.4'5  Studies performed in models of the inflammatory and immune response indicate that MIF acts  extracellularly by stimulating the specific response of target cells. In 1996 however, Rorsman et al. reported that  recombinant MIF (rMIF) catalyzes a tautomerization reaction, converting the non-naturally occurring D-isomer  of dopachrome (2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone) to dihydroxyindole carboxylic acid (DHICA).6  Intriguingly, subsequent elucidation of the three-dimensional crystal structure of MIF revealed it to exhibit  significant three-dimensional (but not primary sequence) homology with two bacterial isomerases, 4-  oxalocrotonate tautomerase and 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate isomerase.7-9 These proteins share with  MIF an apparently conserved active site structure that consists of a hydrophobic cleft bearing an active site  proline. More recently, Rorsman and colleagues have proposed that MIF acts physiologically to catalyze the  keto-enol tautomerization of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate.lFinally, the presence of the CXXC    *Present Address: Chemical Development, New Product Research, R.

In two separate studies, the creation of an enzymatically-inactive form  of MIF by site-directed mutagenesis shows the protein retains full glucocorticoid-regulatory activity,12 but loses  neutrophil priming activity)3 In an effort to further explore the mechanism of action of MIF in biological  systems, we have endeavored to identify potential small molecule inhibitors of MIF's isomerization activity. We  report herein a study of MIF substrate analogs which inhibit dopachrome tautomerization at concentrations  tenfold less than substrate. Such inhibitors may prove useful in the study of MIF structure function relationships  and also assist in the development of small molecules that can be specifically targeted to MIF for  pharmacological purposes.  Materials and Methods  Reagents. All chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MA) or Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI).

The MIF-substrates lb-4b (Table 1) and the test  inhibitors 5b-llb were prepared by oxidizing their precursors la-4a and 5a-10a with soCum periodate,7'8 as  shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 7a and 8a were prepared from 5a and 6a by an esterification procedure.8 The  oxidation was performed 10 min prior to the tautomerization assay and the dopachrome compounds were tested  without further purification.

The DOPA-related precursors (la-10a) were prepared as 10  mM stock solutions in MIF assay buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0). Thirty minutes before the  tautomerization assay, 1.0 mL of each stock solution was diluted with 7 mL of assay buffer, and 1.0 mL of  sodium periodate stock solution (20 mM in water) was added to initiate the oxidation of the precursors, thus  generating each respective dopachrome derivative (lb-10b))5 After 10 min, 1 mL of methionine (20 mM in    X, Zhang, R.

The dopachrome compounds were generated as orange  solutions at a final concentration of 1 mM. Test inhibitors 11-13 were prepared as 10 ~M stock solution and  diluted to 1 mM solution with assay buffer before the assay. To perform the tautomerization assay, 0.5 mL of  the 1 mM solution of the MIF-substrate (lb, 2b, 3b, or 4b) was mixed with 0.5 mL of assay buffer. After the  Table 1.

The  decrease in absorbance (~, = 475 nm) at 1 min following addition of MIF was measured as an index of  tautomerase activity, For the inhibitory assay, 0.5 mL of the 1 mM solution of the MIF-substrate (3b) was mixed  with 0.5 mL of the 1 mM solution of one of the test inhibitors (5b-10b and 11-13), followed by addition of 10  mL of recombinant MIF stock solution (20 mg/mL). Compounds 9b, 10b, and 12 were tested at final  concentrations of 0.25 mM, 0.125 mM, and 0.06 mM in addition to the standard 0.5 mM assay. The percent  inhibition of the decrease in absorbance (~, = 475 nm) at 1 min in the presence of inhibitors was calculated from  the spectrophotometric data by standard methods.6  Results and Discussion  Tautomerization of an orange colored solution of D-dopachrome (lb) by MIF produces the non-colored  DHICA.6 This conversion can be quantitated spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of decrease of the  iminochrome absorbance at a wavelength of 475 nm. The methyl ester derivatives of D- (or L-) dopachrome  were found to be better substrates for this reaction than dopachromes (lb and 2b). In our study L-dopachrome  methyl ester 3b was used as a test substrate for the identification of compounds with the ability to inhibit the  tautomerization reaction.  The dopachrome tautomerization by MIF may occur by two different pathways as shown in Scheme 2.  The first proceeds via the initial conversion of dopachrome to indolidine 14 and subsequent rearrangement to an  indole. A possible alternative pathway involves the formation of quinone methide intermediate 15 which is then  transformed further into an indole.    H H  O        H    H H  O        H    H H  .

Initial molecular modeling studies have suggested that the pathway through indolidine  14 might be favored, while comparison to structurally related tautomerases and more recent mechanistic data  have favored the quinone methide pathway. 16,17 It is known that s-methyl quinone methide have UV and visible    X.

This observation supports the indolidine pathway  described above and suggests that R-proton extraction is the initial step in dopachrome tautomerization by MIF.  L- and DL-~-methyl dopachrome (Sb and 6b) and their methyl esters (7b and 8b), when present at the  same concentration (0.5 mM) as the MIF-substrate 3b, each displayed a moderate inhibitory effect on MIF  tautomerase activity, with the esters showing slightly higher activity than the free acids as shown in Table 1. The  moderate inhibitory activity of or-substituted dopachromes may result from the competition with MIF-substrate  3b for the active site of MIF protein.  To identify inhibitors with higher activity, we needed to design compounds with stronger binding  affinity or even ones capable of binding covalently to the MIF protein thereby blocking the active site and  possibly changing the secondary structure of MIF.  As proposed in Scheme 3, dopachromes with a leaving group at ~l-position may form a very reactive  intermediate 16 following et-deprotonation by MIF. Compound 16 may react with nucleophilic residues of the  MIF protein to form a covalent bond with the protein. Our data have indeed shown that 9b, 10b, and 11 all  displayed strong inhibition on MIF tautomerase activity (Table 1). Particularly, compounds 9b, lOb, and 11 all  showed about 50% inhibition even at a concentration four times less than that of MIF-substrate. Further, 10b  and 11 showed activity at a concentration ten times less than that of MIF-substrate. Studies of the proposed  MIF-covalent complexes (MIF-10b or 11) by mass spectrometry were, however, inconclusive. Detailed  elucidation of the nature of enhanced binding of these inhibitors to MIF requires further study.

Thus, compounds 12 and 13 were tested and found to be inactive in the MIF  tautomerization assay.  We have identified several inhibitors of MIF tautomerase activity. This discovery should lead to the  development of inhibitors of MIF biological activities and the development of agents for the treatment of MIF  related diseases.
