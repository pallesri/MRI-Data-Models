 LoVoDx cells are derived from initially highly doxorubicin-sensitive LoVo adenocarcinoma cells by incubation and selection on increasing doxorubicin concentrations (Grandi et al., 1986; Rivoltini et al., 1990 ). Resistance is based on the expression of multidrug resistance (MDR1) phenotype mediated by the P-glycoprotein drug extrusion mechanism (Rivoltini et al., 1990; Bertram et al., 1995 ). Okadaic acid and cantharidic acid are selective inhibitors of ser/thr phosphatases 1 and 2A (Cohen, 1989; Honkanen, 1993; Honkanen et al., 1994 ). Via the inhibition of these enzymes both agents have been shown to induce apoptosis in many human and non-human cell lines (Bøe et al., 1991; Kiguchi et al., 1994; Morana et al., 1996; Laidley et al., 1997; Tergau et al., 1997; von Zezschwitz et al., 1997 ). By selection techniques cells could be isolated that were resistant to okadaic acid (Takeda et al., 1994; Ritz et al., 1997 ) as well as cantharidic acid (Richter et al., 1998 ). In some resistant lines, at least in the case of okadaic acid, observations suggested that MDR1 expression might be involved (Tohda et al., 1994, 1997; Zheng et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1995; Ritz et al., 1997 ). In the present study we first tested whether LoVo cells respond with apoptosis when they were treated with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic or cantharidic acid. Next, we compared the response of these cells with that observed in doxorubicin-resistant LoVoDx cells. While okadaic and cantharidic acid effectively killed LoVo cells, LoVoDx cells were resistant to doxorubicin as well as to okadaic acid. On the other hand, LoVoDx cells seemed to be even more sensitive to cantharidic acid. Comparable results were obtained with rat pituitary GH3  cells made resistant to 150 nM okadaic acid. Incubation of LoVoDx cells in medium devoid of doxorubicin for several months resulted in the loss of okadaic acid and doxorubicin resistance.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Doxorubicin was from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Okadaic acid and cantharidic acid were purchased from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Cell culture reagents and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies (Eggenstein, Germany). Caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA and the inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO were obtained from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany).  2.2 Cell culture and selection of resistant cells LoVo and GH3  rat pituitary cells were maintained in monolayer in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, streptomycin and penicillin at 37°C in 5% CO2 . LoVoDx cells (Rivoltini et al., 1990 ) were cultured under the same conditions and fed once a week with 1 μg/ml doxorubicin. Okadaic acid-resistant GH3  cells were selected by culturing partially resistant cells (Ritz et al., 1997 ) for an additional 12 months in stepwise raised okadaic acid concentrations with subsequent survival at 150 nM. Okadaic acid (150 nM) was added once a week to the incubation medium.  2.3 Viability assay (MTT conversion assay) Cell suspensions (100 μl; 7.5–10×103  cells/well) were seeded into a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 24 h. Then cells were incubated for 24–72 h with various drug concentrations in serum-free insulin–transferrin–selenite medium followed by the addition of 10 μl MTT solution (5 mg/ml) and incubation for 60 min. After addition of 100 μl 20% SDS in 0.02 N HCl cells were incubated for 24 h and MTT conversion was measured at 550 and 650 nm using a Molecular Devices UV max microplate reader (Ritz et al., 1997 ).  2.4 Measurement of caspase-3 like activity In order to evaluate if cytotoxicity of the tested drugs is apoptotic and therefore associated with the activation of caspases, cells (2–3×106 ) were plated on 10-cm culture dishes. After 24-h incubation with complete medium, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h with the indicated treatments in serum-free medium. Cells were harvested after the addition of 20 μl PMSF (100 mM) per 1 ml medium, and centrifuged at 360×g  for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was transferred to a second vial, washed with PBS supplemented with PMSF (20 μl/ml). After a second centrifugation (600×g , 5 min, 4°C) 600 μl reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1% NP-40, Aprotinin 10 μg/ml at pH 7.4) was added and the resuspended pellet frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellet was stored at −20°C until the assay was performed. After thawing cell disruption was completed by two additional freeze–thaw cycles. Following a centrifugation at 5000×g  for 10 min at 4°C the supernatant was used for protein determination with the BCA assay (Pierce, Heidelberg, Germany). Protein was adjusted to 50 μg/100 μl. Reactions were performed with 100 μg protein in a final volume of 350 μl after addition of DTT (final concentration 5 mM) at 37°C. Reactions were started by the addition of the substrate peptide Ac-DEVD-pNA (final concentration 25 μM). Caspase-3 like activity was quantified by measuring the release of p -nitroanilide at 405 nm in a microplate reader. Enzyme activity was calculated and expressed as U/mg protein. To account for non-specific proteolytic activity the values presented are the difference of the absolute conversion minus the activity not suppressible by 100 nM of the DEVDase inhibitor peptide Ac-DEVD-CHO.   3 Results When LoVo cells were incubated with okadaic acid (100 nM) and cantharidic acid (10 μM) for 24 h, both treatments resulted in morphological features like rounding of cells that are indicative of the induction of apoptotic cell death. This hypothesis was confirmed by measuring and comparing caspase activity as evidenced by the cleavage of the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA with the two phosphatase inhibitors as well as doxorubicin (1 μg/ml). This tetrapeptide is supposed to be mainly a substrate of caspases-3 and -7. All treatment regimens resulted in a significant stimulation of DEVDase activity with activity ratios of threefold (doxorubicin 1 μg/ml), fivefold (okadaic acid 100 nM) and sixfold (cantharidic acid 10 μM) (Fig. 1  A). Thus, like many other tumour cells LoVo cells respond with apoptosis when ser/thr phosphatases 1 and 2A, the enzymes predominantly inhibited by okadaic acid and cantharidic acid at these concentrations, are inhibited for a longer period of time (>12 h). Next we tested for the viability loss of LoVo cells treated for 24 h with doxorubicin (0.33–10 μg/ml), okadaic acid (25–300 nM) and cantharidic acid (1–25 μM) (Fig. 2  A–C, filled symbols). At the most effective concentrations these agents induced a loss in viability of about 40–60%. This effect was achieved with 10 μg/ml doxorubicin, 300 nM okadaic acid and 25 μM cantharidic acid. When cells were treated for up to 72 h (Fig. 2 A–C, open symbols) toxicity observed with all three agents was significantly more pronounced resulting in overall death rates of 80–90% compared to maximally 40–60% cells that died after 24 h (Fig. 2 B). With doxorubicin and okadaic acid 40% viability loss was observed with 1 μg/ml and 25 nM, respectively, while cantharidic acid was about 2.5 times more effective with 40% of cells dying between 5 and 10 μM after 72 h compared to 40% of cells dying at 25 μM after 24 h. Sensitivity of different strains of tumour cells to the cytotoxicity induced by phosphatase inhibitors was shown to differ substantially (Sakurada et al., 1992 ). In order to investigate these aspects in more detail, we studied toxicity of these agents in LoVoDx cells which had become at least 10-fold less responsive to doxorubicin (Rivoltini et al., 1990 ) by culture in increasing concentrations of doxorubicin. Resistance of these cells is mediated via the enhanced expression of P-glycoprotein (Rivoltini et al., 1990; Bertram et al., 1995 ) resulting in MDR1 phenotype (Gottesmann and Pastan, 1993 ). When either LoVo or LoVoDx cells were cultured for 72 h with the three drugs we observed substantially different behaviours. While as expected LoVoDx cells were more than 10-fold less sensitive to doxorubicin resulting in a rightward shift of the toxicity curve (Fig. 3  A), cells treated with okadaic acid also showed such a rightward shift, albeit toxicity was only reduced by a factor of about 6–8 (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, LoVoDx cells treated with cantharidic acid displayed a leftward shift of the toxicity curve since these resistant cells were about 2- to 2.5-fold more sensitive to this agent (Fig. 3 C) with 80% of LoVoDx cells killed at 10 μM vs. 80% LoVo cells killed at 25 μM. This different behaviour with respect to the response to cantharidic acid vs. that to doxorubicin and okadaic acid was confirmed by measurements of Ac-DEVD-pNA conversion in LoVoDx cells treated with the three agents. While in these cells doxorubicin and okadaic acid showed no increase of caspase 3-like activity when compared to untreated LoVoDx cells (Fig. 1 B), only in extracts of cantharidic acid-treated cells was caspase activity higher than in extracts from untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). Caspase activity in untreated LoVoDx cells was about 5.5-fold that observed in untreated LoVo cells. From these observations we conclude that P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR can protect LoVoDx cells not only from doxorubicin but also, albeit to a lesser extent from okadaic acid toxicity. This is in accordance with observations by various groups (Tohda et al., 1994, 1997; Zheng et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1995; Ritz et al., 1997 ) obtained with okadaic acid-resistant cells selected on increasing concentrations of okadaic acid in the culture medium. This protection has been shown by functional and biochemical data to be the consequence of overexpression of the MDR1 mediating P-glycoprotein. On the other hand, cells which showed a reduced sensitivity to okadaic acid mainly by overexpression of the P-glycoprotein displayed no cross resistance to cantharidic acid (Ritz et al., 1997 ). Similar results are shown for a okadaic acid-resistant subline of rat pituitary GH3  cells that proliferated at 150 nM okadaic acid which is about 15-fold the initially lethal concentration (Fig. 4  ). In this subline significant okadaic acid toxicity after 72 h was only seen with a concentration of 300 nM, while nearly 50% of parental cells had already died at 25 nM okadaic acid (Fig. 4 B). In agreement with the hypothesis that MDR1 is underlying this loss in sensitivity, these cells were also about 10-fold more resistant to doxorubicin toxicity with 75% of cells killed at 1 μg/ml in parental vs. 75% killed at 10 μg/ml in the okadaic acid-resistant cells (Fig. 4 A). In accordance with our observations with the LoVo lines cantharidic acid (15 μM) toxicity was increased in the resistant GH3  lines with only 20% of cells surviving after 72 h compared to about 45% in the parental line (Fig. 4 C). To further supplement our observations on the responsiveness of LoVo cells and lines derived from these cells we studied the loss of drug resistance by omission of doxorubicin from the culture medium. Four months after removal of doxorubicin the toxicity of okadaic acid and doxorubicin was compared between these cells and LoVoDx as well as parental LoVo cells. Interestingly, sensitivity of these revertant cells for doxorubicin was in between that observed with LoVoDx and LoVo cells (Fig. 5  A). Resistance to okadaic acid was completely lost in these revertants, only at the lowest concentrations tested (25 nM) was survival slightly higher than in parental LoVo cells (Fig. 5 B). Loss of MDR in these cells was also confirmed by measuring the accumulation of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 which as a substrate of the P-glycoprotein achieves lower steady state levels in resistant cells. Omission of doxorubicin in the culture medium resulted in normalization of dye accumulation (data not shown).  4 Discussion The data presented in this study confirm our earlier observations as well as those of other groups that inhibition of ser/thr phosphatases, especially PP1 and 2A, by selective inhibitors like okadaic acid and cantharidic acid, can be considered a new cytotoxic principle for tumour cells (Bøe et al., 1991; Kiguchi et al., 1994; Morana et al., 1996; Laidley et al., 1997; Tergau et al., 1997; von Zezschwitz et al., 1997 ). Like doxorubicin, the two tested agents, okadaic acid and cantharidic acid, induced apoptosis in LoVo cells. The extent of cell death was comparable between the three agents. Different cell lines can develop resistance to okadaic acid-induced apoptosis by the development of a MDR1 phenotype (Tohda et al., 1994, 1997; Zheng et al., 1994; Wang et al., 1995; Ritz et al., 1997 ). Here we could show that MDR1 expressing LoVo cells resistant to doxorubicin (LoVoDx) displayed a comparable cross resistance to okadaic acid which was further confirmed by the observation that an okadaic acid-resistant GH3  line revealed a comparably reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin. In accordance with this conclusion reduction of doxorubicin resistance in a revertant LoVoDx line is associated with the loss of okadaic acid resistance. Thus, okadaic acid can be considered a drug that is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein-mediating MDR1. Studying toxicity of this agent and structurally related derivatives should consider the contribution of this drug extrusion mechanism for the correct interpretation of the results. On the other hand, cytotoxicity of cantharidic acid, an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A comparable to okadaic acid, is not reduced but is even slightly enhanced in LoVoDx cells. The potential increased sensitivity of LoVoDx cells was confirmed with the okadaic acid-resistant GH3  cells but should be confirmed with other MDR lines before general conclusions can be drawn. Thus, cantharidic acid does not seem to be a substrate of the P-glycoprotein and might therefore be the drug of choice for testing the new cytotoxic principle of ser/thr phosphatase inhibition in MDR1 expressing tumour cells.
