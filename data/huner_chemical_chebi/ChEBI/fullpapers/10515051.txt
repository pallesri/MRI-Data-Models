 The medical use of the extracts of Echinacea purpurea  is long known and the polysaccharide components of these extracts have been systematically investigated by Wagner et al. [1–3] . As a result of these studies, the polysaccharides of Echinacea purpurea  are produced in industrial scale by cell cultures [4,5] . These polysaccharides are 4-O- methylglucuronoarabinoxylans [3]  and arabinorhamnogalactans [3] . Most recently an arabinogalactan fraction possessing promising biological activity was isolated [6]  (Scheme 1  ). Structure elucidation suggested that all third or fourth galactose units of the β-(1→6)-linked galactan skeleton contain either an α-l -arabinofuranosyl or an α-l -arabinofuranosyl-(1→5)-α-l -arabinofuranosyl side chain. The presence of a rather similar structural unit is supposed by Albersheim et al. [7]  in the polysaccharide isolated from suspension-cultured sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus ). Three different tetrasaccharide derivatives were synthesized most recently by van Boom et al. [8]  for the characterisation of several monoclonal antibodies elucidated by the epitopes of polysaccharides isolated from Acer pseudoplatanus .  2 . Results and discussion The aim of the present synthetic work was to establish a method for the preparation of well-defined parts of the next two structural units and employ these oligosaccharides to raise monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies might be suitable tools for structure elucidation of plant polysaccharides [9] . To the best of our knowledge there are only four examples in the literature [8,10–12]  for the preparation of non-symmetrically 2,6-di-O- glycosylated β-d -galactopyranosyl derivatives. Now we report our first results obtained with some oligosaccharides having the desired minimal structural unit. We were the first to report [13]  that the reaction of alkyl β-d -galactopyranosides with 2,2-dimethoxypropane in the presence of a catalytic amount of p -toluenesulfonic acid resulted in alkyl 3,4-O- isopropylidene-6-O -(methoxydimethyl)methyl-β-d -galactopyranosides. Other authors [14–16]  succesfully used this procedure for the preparation of different galactopyranoside derivatives having a free OH-2 group, and abbreviated the (methoxydimethyl)methyl group as MIP (2-methoxy-isopropyl). In the knowledge of this reaction, our strategy was to galactosylate a galactopyranos(e)yl unit having free OH-6, and after deprotection of the second galactosyl unit and treatment with 2,2-dimethoxypropane, a partially protected digalactose having the OH-2′ free was expected to be obtained. This should be amenable to direct arabinosylation. Based on the above considerations, 1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose [17]  (1 ) was glycosylated with α-acetobromo-d -galactose under Helferich conditions ( Schemes 2 and 3  ) and the known 6-O -(2,3,4,6-tetra-O -acetyl-β-d -galactopyranosyl)-1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose [18]  (2 ) was obtained. Compound 2  was deacetylated to give 6-O -(β-d -galactopyranosyl)-1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose [19]  (3 ), and this disaccharide was treated with 50 equivalents of neat 2,2-dimethoxypropane in the presence of p -toluenesulfonic acid. A nearly quantitative reaction yielded 6-O- (3,4-O- isopropropylidene-6-O- (methoxydimethyl)methyl-β-d -galactopyranosyl)-1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose (4 ). Compound 5  with 6′-OH free was formed only as a side product. The direct treatment of β-d -galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-d -galactose (6 ) with 2,2-dimethoxypropane also resulted in compound 4 . The MIP derivatives show very easily characterisable 1 H and 13 C NMR signals: in compound 4  there were eight C-methyl signals in the 1 H NMR spectrum between 1.50 and 1.30 ppm; the OCH3  group resonated at 3.12 ppm. In the 13 C NMR spectrum the quaternary acetal carbon of the (methoxydimethyl)methyl group resonated at 100.1 ppm, the C-6 showed a rather strong upfield shift at 60.26 ppm, and the OCH3  signal appeared at 48.53 ppm. These signals also helped the structure elucidation of other, more complex oligosaccharide derivatives. To synthesize the trisaccharide repeating unit of structure I , compound 4  seemed to be a good candidate as the aglycone. Arabinosylation of 4  with 2,3,5-tri-O- benzoyl-α-l -arabinofuranosyl bromide [20]  (7 ) using Hg(CN)2  as promoter resulted in three chromatographically well-separable substances, but, unfortunately, none of them contained the MIP group. The fully protected compound proved to be 6-O- [2,6-di-O- (2,3,5-tri-O- benzoyl-α-l -arabinofuranosyl)-3,4-O- isopropylidene-β-d -galactopyranosyl-]-1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose (8 ). The presence of three quaternary acetalic signals (110.24, 108.99 and 108.21 ppm), the four anomeric carbon signals (105.67, 103.73, 101.19 and 95.94 ppm), the absence of the MIP group and the glycosylation shift at the carbon C-6′ verified the structure of compound 8 . The second product in the reaction mixture proved to be the trisaccharide 9 . The three anomeric carbon signals resonated at 105.60, 103.36 and 96.14 ppm, the C-6′ was glycosylated (C-6′: 65.72 ppm), and three dioxolane-type isopropylidene groups were present (109.89, 109.35 and 108.64 ppm). Acetylation of 9  gave the monoacetyl derivative (10 ) and one proton triplet was shifted to the lower field. The acetylated OH group was assigned as OH-2′, having the triplet at 5.08 ppm, and 8.5 Hz coupling constants assignable to J 1′,2′  and J 2′,3′ . The third (minor) component was also a trisaccharide (11 ), in which C-6′ (62.38 ppm) was free, three acetal rings were present (109.98, 109.46 and 108.74 ppm), and an arabinofuranosyl unit was anchored at C-2′. This compound was the planned trisaccharide, although without the terminal MIP substitutent: 6-O- [2-O- (2,3,5-tri-O- benzoyl-α-l -arabinofuranosyl)-3,4-O- isopropylidene-β-d -galactopyranosyl]-1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose (11 ). In the knowledge of the extreme acid-sensitive properties of the MIP derivatives, the formation of the above oligosaccharides (8, 9  and 11 ) can be easily explained. In the initial stage of the glycosylation reaction the OH-2′ is the only nucleophilic partner and the MIP-containing 12  (vide infra) was produced. During this reaction mercury bromide was also formed and this rather strong Lewis acid hydrolysed the acid-sensitive MIP blocking group. Then, reaction of the more nucleophilic OH-6′ resulted in the trisaccharide derivative 9 , and the excess of the glycosyl donor glycosylated it to the tetrasaccharide main product 8 . The small amount of compound 11  formed from its 6-OMIP derivative (12 ), which did not lose its MIP during the coupling reaction, but was cleaved during the work-up procedure. Similar reaction mixtures were obtained by using Ag2 O or Ag2 CO3  promoters. To avoid the cleavage of the MIP group we executed the glycosylation reaction promoted by AgOTf in the presence of sym -collidine (2,4,6-trimethylpyridine), hoping that this strong base can prevent the hydrolysis of the acid-sensitive mixed acetalic protecting group. The reaction proceeded with an acceptable rate and two products (12  and 13 ) were formed. It was also observed that the chromatographically faster-moving component (12 ) was transformed into the slower-moving one (13 ). Although the two products showed very similar chromatographic mobility, their separation could be achieved rather easily. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of the faster-moving component showed the presence of the MIP group (δ : 3.2 ppm, OCH 3  , 24 H was integrated between δ : 1.18–1.62 ppm), and three benzoyl moieties were also present. The 13 C NMR spectrum was more informative; three dioxolane-type acetalic carbon signals could be assigned (δ : 110.15, 109.06 and 108.31), the three anomeric carbon atoms resonated at 103.82, 101.28 and 96.04 ppm, and the quaternary acetalic carbon atom of the MIP appeared at 100.10 ppm. The O-6′ contained the -O- C(CH3 )2 -OCH3  group, an upfield shift of ∼2 ppm could be detected (δ : 60.08 ppm) and the OC H3  group resonated at 48.49 ppm. Mild acid hydrolysis of the MIP group in compound 12  resulted in 11  in a quantitative yield. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of the second, slower-moving compound (13 ) showed a trisaccharide character. The spectra did not contain OCH3  signal(s), but there was a quaternary carbon signal at 100.5 ppm which could be an acetalic carbon resonance. The C-6′ also appeared at high field (δ : 60.18 ppm), and there were 21 hydrogens in the methyl-proton region. These spectral data suggested a symmetrical isopropylidene acetal structure in which the alcoholic components were the two trisaccharide molecules; its composition can be depicted by structure 13 . Formation of symmetrical dimerization products of monosaccharides having similar structure to 13  was reported by Barresi and Hindsgaul [21]  in a publication dealing with synthesis of β-mannopyranosides by intramolecular aglycone delivery. The assumed structure of 13  was verified by MALDI-TOF MS measurement giving m /z : 1853.9. In the spectrum of compound 13  two additional fragments appeared with m /z : 906.5 and 946.5; the first could be assigned to 11  and the second to the 6-O- isopropenyl ether of 11 . The symmetrical acetalic bond in compound 13  is more stable than the bonds of the mixed acetals (MIP) but more sensitive than the cyclic dioxolane-type isopropylidene acetals. Mild acid hydrolysis of 13  resulted in 11  with a quantitative yield. Compound 11  can be a choice as the aglycone for additional glycosylation, or even an aglycone for dimerisation into the hexasaccharide I . These results demonstrate that the easily available MIP derivatives can serve as aglycones in glycosylation reactions, but basic or neutral conditions are required for the coupling reactions and also for the work-up procedure. It is known that the MIP derivatives can be successfully etherified under basic conditions [15]  (Scheme 4  ). Benzylation of compound 4  gave the fully protected crystalline disaccharide 14  (Scheme 2 ). Selective hydrolysis of the MIP fgroup resulted in the crystalline 6-O- (2-O- benzyl-3,4-O- isopropylidene-β-d -galactopyranosyl)-1,2:3,4-di-O- isopropylidene-α-d -galactopyranose (15 ). Complete hydrolysis of the isopropylidene acetals either of 14  or 15  gave 6-O- (2-O- benzyl-β-d -galactopyranosyl)-d -galactose (16 ). Acetylation of 16  afforded the peracetylated derivative (17 ) from which, after hydrogenolysis, 6-O- (3,4,6-tri-O- acetyl-β-d -galactopyranosyl)-1,2,3,4-tetra-O- acetyl-α,β-d -galactopyranose (18 ) was obtained. Compound 18  could be arabinosylated with 7  and the persubstituted trisaccharide 19  was isolated. For the removal of the isopropylidene groups of the oligosaccharides 8 , 9 , 11  and 13  aqueous 90% trifluoroacetic acid was used. The acyl groups were removed by Zemplén transesterification to furnish the tetrasaccharide 20  from compound 8  and the trisaccharide 21  from the protected 9 . The target trisaccharide 22  was obtained from three different protected intermediates: 11 , 13  and 19  (Scheme 5  ). Detailed two-dimensional (2D) 1 H and 13 C NMR studies resulted in the pertinent spectral assignments. The 13 C NMR data of the protected derivatives are collected in Table 1  . Similar measurements were done in the case of the free oligosaccharides, too. These trisaccharides, in aqueous solutions, occur as mixture of two anomers, but in the case of the branched tetrasaccharide 20 , the reducing d -galactose unit existed in four isomeric forms (α-, β-pyranose and α-, and β-furanose forms) and in the equilibrium mixture the quadruplication of some individual carbon-13 signals could be detected. Similar spectral behaviours have been reported earlier from our laboratory [22,23]  (Scheme 6  ).  3 . Experimental 3.1 General methods Optical rotations were measured at room temperature with a Perkin–Elmer 241 automatic polarimeter. Melting points were determined on a Kofler apparatus and are uncorrected. TLC was performed on Kieselgel 60 F254  (E. Merck) with detection by charring with 50% of aqueous sulfuric acid. Column chromatography was performed on Silica Gel 60 (E. Merck 0.063–0.200 mm). The organic solution was dried over MgSO4 , and concentrated in a vacuum.
