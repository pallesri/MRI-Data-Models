   Evidence has accumulated supporting the concept that reactive oxygen metabolites, including free radical spe­cies (such as superoxide and hydroxyl), and other oxygen metabolites (such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlo­rous acid) play an important role in tissue injury (BAUD and ARDALILLOU 1986). Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated reactive oxygen metabolites in various forms of toxic nephropathy (PALLER et al. 1984; WALKER and SHAH 1987, 1988; PALLER 1988; SHAH 1989). The putative site of injury in most forms of toxic nephropathy is the epithelial cells lining the tubules (BREZIS et al. 1991). From this viewpoint, therefore, protecting these cells from toxic oxygen metabolites may reduce the risk of renal disorders.   Although a native scavenger system is capable ofdoing this, it may lose its activity under pathogenic conditions due to organ dysfunction and an excess of free radicals. Therefore, supplementation with chemical scavengers would be necessary in order to decompose these excess pathogenic metabolites.   In this study, we evaluated the membrane protective effects of some flavonoids on the LLC-PKj cell line, which maintains the differentiated characteristics of renal proximal tubular cells (CANTIELLO et al. 1987). This cell line has been used extensively in in vitro studies to examine both physiologic and pathophysiologic mecha­nisms in renal tubules (CANTIELLO et al. 1987; MULLIN and McGINN 1988; ANDREOLI and McATEER 1990; ER­COLANI et al. 1990; YOKOZAWA et al. 1997a, 1997b). The purposes of this study were to screen out a potentially useful agent for cell membrane protection, and to shed light on the possible mechanism of this process.       Material and methods   Compounds: Flavones (acacetin, apigenin, apiin, bai­calein, baicalin, chrysoeriol, cirsilineol, cirsiliol, cirsimarin, cirsimaritin, cosmosiin, genkwanin, 6-hydroxyluteolin, linarin, luteolin, luteolin 7 -glucoside, pectolinarigenin, pec­tolinarin, plantaginin, rhoifolin, scutellarein, sorbarin, tecto­chrysin and toringin) and flavonols (afzelin, chrysosplenol B, chrysosplenol C, chrysosplenol D, hyperin, isoquercitrin, isorhamnetin, kaempferitrin, kaempferol, kaempferol-7­glucoside, oxyayanin A, quercetin, quercimeritrin, quer­citrin, rhamnetin, rutin and tetramethylquercitin) used in this experiment were isolated from natural sources.   Medium and reagents: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (D-MEMIF-12) and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Life Technologies,   Exp Toxic Patho151 (1999) 1     ries (Cleveland, OH, USA), respectively. A commercial kit (lactate dehydrogenase ClI-Test Wako) for assaying lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan.   Cultured cell experiments: Commercially available LLC-PK1 cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified at­mosphere of 5 % CO2 in air (routine conditions) on culture plates with 5 %FCS-supplemented D-MEM/F-12 medium. After confluence had been reached, the cells were seeded on fresh 96-well culture plates at 104 per well. Each flavonoid compound was added to the culture 2 h later, and the plates were incubated under routine conditions for 48 h. Leakage of LDH into the culture medium was assayed using a com­mercial kit. The level of lipid peroxidant released from the cultured cells was estimated by measuring the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) as described by YAGI (1976). All assays were performed 5 times.   Statistics: Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by Dunnett's test. Signifi­cance was accepted at p < 0.05.     Results   Flavone-type compounds: Eighteen of 24 flavones (75 %) demonstrated different degrees of membrane pro­tective activity. Baicalin, cirsimaritin, 6-hydroxyluteolin, luteolin, plantaginin, rhoifolin and sorbarin appeared to be the most effective compounds for preventing LDH leakage, since only a very low concentration of 0.25 Ilg/ml was needed for coculture with the cells, as shown in table   1.   Cirsimarin, luteolin 7 -glucoside, pectolinarigenin, tec­tochrysin and toringin showed significant inhibition at a concentration of 0.5 Ilg/ml. Five compounds, baicalein, chrysoeriol, cirsiliol, linarin and scutellarein, suppressed the leakage significantly at a minimum concentration of     2.5   Ilg/ml. However, the other flavone compounds acted only weakly in comparison with those described above. In addition, LDH efflux was apparently associated with the MDA level. The amount ofthis lipid peroxidant form­ed declined markedly when the cells were cultured in the presence of baicalin, cirsimarin, cirsimaritin, 6-hydroxy­luteolin, luteolin, luteolin 7-glucoside, pectolinarigenin, plantaginin, rhoifolin, sorbarin and tectochrysin. The in­hibition ofMDA formation by these compounds was con­centration-dependent.       Flavonol-type compounds: As shown in table 2, most flavonol compounds tested (14 out of 17) revealed much higher activity in preventing enzyme efflux. Afzelin, hy­perin, isoquercitrin, isorhamnetin, kaempferitrin, kaemp­ferol-7 -glucoside, oxyayanin A, quercetin, quercitrin, rhamnetin and rutin were markedly effective because the released LDH was significantly decreased when they were cocultured with the cells even at a concentration of   0.25 Ilg/ml, isoquercitrin and isorhamnetin exerting the strongest effect. Higher concentrations of chrysosplenol B and chrysosplenol C (20 times those of the above com­pounds) were required to inhibit LDH release to the same extent, but tetramethylquercitin did not affect LDH re-  Exp Toxic Pathol 51 (1999) 1   MDA leakage from LLC-PK1   Compound  Con­   centration    (Ilg/ml)    Acacetin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Apigenin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Apiin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Baicalein  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Baicalin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Chrysoeriol  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Cirsilineol  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Cirsiliol  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Cirsimarin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Cirsimaritin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5    Cosmosiin  0.25    0.5    2.5    5      cells.

The generation of MDA was found to be markedly decreased in the groups with decreased LDH efflux, which indicated a possible cause and effect relationship between them.   Exp Toxic Patho151 (1999) 1   One ofremarkable features ofcellular injury is leakage ofLDH, a soluble cytosolic enzyme, from inside the cells. This leakage is due largely to increased membrane per­meability, which is probably modified by certain factors such as antineoplastic drugs, radiation, and attack by oxy­gen free radical species. It is therefore a useful indicator of membrane integrity and provides a convenient ap­proach for cytotoxicity evaluation. On the other hand, ANDREOLI and McATEER (1990), RaVIN et al. (1990) and WALKER and SHAH (1991) have reported that renal tubule cells have the potential to produce reactive oxygen meta­bolites in response to various stimuli, and are the major site affected in renal failure. In this study, therefore, we used LDH leakage from LLC-PK1 cells as an indicator to evaluate cellular membrane permeability upon incubation with 41 flavonoids under normal culture conditions.   Flavonoids are phenolic compounds widely distributed in plants, with thousands of individual substances known, and the list is constantly expanding. These important bio­active compounds have been shown to have many medi­cal uses, such as diuresis, laxation, and antispasmodic, antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory actions (MITsv­HASHI et al. 1989). Most of the compounds we tested in this study also showed significant effectiveness in in­hibiting the efflux of LDH from LLC-PK1 cells, and thus appeared to change the permeability of the cellular mem­brane. To determine the nature of their effect, we measur­ed the MDA content in the culture medium, and found that under routine culture conditions such as 5 % CO2, 95 % air and 37 DC for 48 h, a certain amount of MDA was generated. This suggests that LDH efflux from the cells may be due largely to lipid peroxidation of the mem­brane, although this may occur slowly under normal con­ditions. Interestingly, when the cells were cocultured with different types of flavones and flavonols, the levels of both LDH and MDA in the medium showed an obvious de­crease, indicating a possible link between them. Itis there­fore reasonable to infer that an antiperoxidation or free ra­dical scavenging mechanism is involved in this process because of the reducing property of these compounds.   Much attention has been drawn to the antioxidative ac­tivity of flavonoids due to their structure, especially since a superoxidation injury hypothesis has been put forward to explain the etiology and pathology of some diseases, and this has prompted extensive studies on their antioxi­dative and lipid peroxidation-inhibiting potential. Our data revealed that the action of flavonoids was closely re­lated to their chemical structures. First, as shown in table 3, those that demonstrated marked inhibition of LDH efflux activity possess more phenolic hydroxyl groups linked to the backbone. For example, having an extra OH at the 3-position made 10 of the 17 flavonols tested here exhibit a significant effect at a concentration as low as   0.25 Ilg in the medium; in contrast, among flavone types, only 7 out of 24 (about 29 %) showed such activity at the same concentration, suggesting that hydroxyl groups are of prime importance for their effects.

Most flavone-type compounds gener­ally possessing 6-or 3'-OH in their structure demonstrat­ed marked LDH leakage inhibition and antioxidation activity. For example, baicalin, plantaginin and sorbarin belonged to the former, while luteolin and luteolin 7-glu­coside were ofthe latter type; 6-hydroxyluteolin had both. However, there were some exceptions. Although lacking 6-and 3'-OH, cirsimaritin and rhoifolin still showed membrane protection and banding MDA production; in contrast, baicalein, cirsiliol and scutellarein showed a weak effect, even though they possess either 6-0H or 3'­OH. The reason for this remains unclear. In addition, it has been observed that linked sugar might contribute to membrane protection. Among the most effective com­pounds in this study -baicalin, cirsimaritin, 6-hydroxy­luteolin, luteolin, plantaginin, rhoifolin and sorbarin ­four possess glucuronic acid, glucose or rhamnose. This implies that sugar may account for the varying radical scavenger activity through changing the electron distri­bution and participating in electron delocalization on the structural backbone, or through some other unknown mechanisms.   Similarly, flavonol-type compounds, having an addi­tional -OH at C-3, performed more effectively than the previous type. Chemically, their actions were probably dependent on C-7, 3' or 4', as well as 3-0H, such as af­zelin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, isorhamnetin, kaempferitrin, kaempferol-7-glucoside, quercetin, quercitrin, rhamnetin and rutin. Sugar linked at C-3 would also affect antioxi­dation capability. For example, a lack of 3'-OH, but pos­session of rhamnoses at C-3 and 7, made kaempferitrin act powerfully in both membrane protection and anti­peroxidation, similarly to afzelin, hyperin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-7 -glucoside, quercitrin and rutin.   In terms of results, we attempted to draw a general con­cept about the structural principles necessary for optimal cellular membrane protection and antioxidative capacity. It is assumed that the bioactivity of both types of com­pounds is decided mainly by the following three impor­tant structural groups: (a) the o-dihydroxy (catechol) structure in the B ring, which is the obvious radical target site for all flavonoids with a saturated 2,3-bond (flavan­3-ols, flavanones); (b) the 2,3-double bond in conjugation with a 4-oxo function, which are responsible for electron delocalization from the B ring; and (c) the additional pre­sence of both 3-and 5-hydroxyl groups for maximal radical-scavenging potential and strongest radical absorp­tion; in fact, the 3-and 5-hydroxyl groups are equivalent owing to their hydrogen bonds with the keto group, from a kinetic standpoint (SLABBERT 1977). These sites can be considered as the active centers on the compounds, or as a prerequisite factor for the scavenging of oxygen free radicals.   Here, we should note that from tables 1 and 2, the po­tentials of the two types of compounds are not absolutely   Exp Toxic Pathol51 (1999) 1   affected by whether they are flavonoids or aglycones. It is thought that the configuration of functional groups may also playa crucial role in determining their bioactivity.
