   We previously reported that representative o~-galactosylceramide (oc-GalCer, galactose bound to ceramide in an c~-configuration), named KRN7000  (1) (Fig. 1), has strong immunostimulatory and antitumor activity. 1,2 KRN7000 has also drawn researchers' attention as a ligand for mouse and human natural killer T (NKT) cells.3-8  Our structure-activity relationship study using ct-GalCers with different ceramide moieties indicated that the 3 hydroxyl group (3-OH) in the ceramide plays an essential role in the manifestation of immunostimulatory activity induced by 0c-GalCers, demonstrating that ot-GalCer with only the 3-OH is the minimal structure to stimulate the immune system through the activation of NKT cells. 1,3   HO  .OH   O ~/(CH2)24CH3       HO .OH    ?H  OH HO QI~,~  HN    .

In order to address this question, we synthesized two kinds of 3-galactosylated ct-GalCers, and compared effects among these two compounds and AGL-506 (2) l (Fig. 1), the parental ot-GalCer, on the proliferation of murine spleen cells.   Chemistry   The synthetic procedures of AGL-529 (3[3-galactosylated t~-GalCer, 3) and AGL-533 (3a-galactosylated o~- GalCer, 4) are shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis of ceramide (5) was reported previously.1 The ceramide (5) was glycosylated with 3 eq. galactosyl donor (6) to give 7 and 8. The mixture of 7 and 8 were directly hydrogenated and subsequent acetylated to give 9 and 10. Deacetylation of 9 and 10 gave AGL-529 (3)j5 and AGL-533 (4),16 respectively.

Results and Discussion   We compared the effects of AGL-506 (tx-GalCer, 2), AGL-529 (313-galactosylated ~-GalCer, 3), and AGL-533 (3c~-galactosylated a-GalCer, 4) on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells. As shown in Table l, AGL-506 stimulated the proliferation of spleen cells in a concentration-dependent fashion, and significant stimulatory activity was observed from the concentration of 1 ng/ml. Although AGL-529 showed significant enhancement of the proliferative effect from the concentration of 10 ng/ml, its potency was weaker than that of AGL-506, the parental o~-GalCer. By contrast, AGL-533 significantly stimulated the proliferation of spleen cells from the concentration of 1 ng/ml, and it appeared that AGL-533 has stronger irnmunostimulatory activity than AGL-506. It is quite interesting that the configuration of the glycosidic linkage between galactose   700                         T. Sakai et al. /Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9 (1999) 697-702   and ceramide in the 3-position greatly affects the ct-GalCer induced immunostimulatory effects, i.e., linkage enhances the immunostimulatory effect of ct-GalCer, but the ]3-linkage reduces the activity.

At the same time, various concentrations of samples (10 Bl/well) were added into each well, and the cell suspension was cultured at 37 , 5% CO2 for 2 days. Then 0.5 BCi/well of tritium-thymidine (3H-TdR) was added into each well, and 16 hours later, the 3H-TdR uptake into the cells was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Each value shows the mean +_ S.D. *; p < 0.05 (vs. vehicle treated group).   Because 3tx-galactosylated ~-GalCer (AGL-533) showed stronger immunostimulatory activity than the parental ~-GalCer (AGL-506) (Table 1), the result arose a question as to whether c~-galactosyl-3-ceramide (~- Gal-3-Cer, galactose bound to ceramide in the 3-position) can stimulate the proliferation of spleen cells as ct- Gal-l-Cers such as KRN7000 and AGL-506 can do. To address this question, we synthesized two kinds of c~-GalCers with only the 3-OH, ct-Gal-l-Cer (AGL-517, 16) and ct-Gal-3-Cer (AGL-553, 17), by the methods shown in Scheme 2.

Each value shows the mean + S.D. *; p < 0.05 (vs. vehicle treated group).   We compared the effects of ct-Gal-l-Cer, AGL-517 (16), and ct-Gal-3-Cer, AGL-553 (17), on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells. As shown in Table 2, AGL-517 stimulated the proliferation of spleen cells in a concentration-dependent fashion, and significant stimulatory activity was observed from the concentration of 1 ng/ml. By contrast, AGL-553 did not stimulate the proliferation of spleen cells even at the highest concentration of 100 ng/ml. Although several research groups have published the reports on various types of   T. Sakai et al. / Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9 (1999) 697-702                         701   cz-GalCers and their derivatives which were isolated from marine sponges9-13,18,19 or were totally synthesized,l,14,20 all compounds are cz-Gal-l-Cers and their derivatives. Since there is no report on cx-Gal-3- Cer as far as we know, this is the first finding that oc-Gal-3-Cer (at least 100 ng/ml) has no immunostimulatory effect. The results shown in Table 1 and 2 demonstrate that {x-binding of galactose not in the 3-position but in the 1-position is essential for the manifestation of immunostimulatory activity by cz-GalCers, and that the 3- position is a preferable site to enhance the activity by the glycosylation. It was demonstrated that CDld-transfectant cells pretreated with KRN7000  activate murine Vczl4 positive NKT cell clones and human Vo~24 positive NKT cell clones, suggesting that CDld molecule plays an essential role in the activation of these NKT cells.4-8 In addition, it was recently proven that radiolabeled KRN700021 and biotinylated o~-GalCers22 actualy bind to mouse CDI and human CDld molecules. These results suggest that the complex of cz-GalCer and CDld molecule is recognized by Vc~14 or Vc~24 T cell receptor on NKT cells. Our computer-aided molecular modeling demonstrated that active compounds such as R-GalCer and ~-glucosylceramide (o~-GlcCer) share active conformations which are not accessible to [3-GalCer and ~-GlcCer.23 Furthermore, the crystallographic structure of mouse CD1 was recently solved by Zeng et al.24 Taken these findings together, it seems to be possible to construct the binding model of CDld/o~-GalCer complex using these data. It is considered that the present study using AGL-506 (2), AGL-529 (3), AGL- 533 (4), AGL-517 (16) and AGL-553 (17) will contribute to the modeling study of CDld/cz-GalCer complex and will be useful to investigate the interaction mechanism among CDId molecules, R-GalCer and T cell receptor.
