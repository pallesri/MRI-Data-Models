 There has been apparent controversy as to the roles nitric oxide (NO) has in different physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms at the molecular level. Some studies show that NO has cytotoxic properties whereas other reports demonstrate that NO prevents or ameliorates injurious conditions; this apparent controversy seems to be due to the fact that both the chemical biology of NO as well as its transducing pathways are not only adopted to cytotoxicity but they also refer to cell protection (for review, see Brune et al., 1998; Wink and Mitchell, 1998 ). NO is a widespread signalling molecule involved in the regulation of multiple cellular functions (for a review, see Moncada et al., 1991 ), most of which are exerted by increasing cyclic GMP concentrations via activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) (for review see Ignarro, 1990; McDonald and Murad, 1996 ), although direct actions of the NO molecule have also been reported. In the case of oxidative damage, NO has been proposed to exert direct neuroprotective actions as an anti-oxidant (Wink et al., 1993; Rauhala et al., 1996, 1998 ). Interestingly, it has been shown that cyclic GMP may also have neuroprotective actions (Weill and Greene, 1984; Garthwaite and Garthwaite, 1988; Barger et al., 1995; Furukawa et al., 1996; Barger and Mattson, 1996; Thippeswamy and Morris, 1997; Pantazis et al., 1998 ). In this context, we have recently shown that superoxide dismutase (SOD) potentiates cell death caused by the generator of NO and O2 −  SIN-1, an effect that was enhanced by the NO scavenger HbO2 , abolished by catalase and accompanied by the formation of H2 O2 , suggesting that this reactive oxygen species (ROS) accounts for this enhancing effect (Moro et al., 1998 ). Our data also suggest that NO released in these conditions, via cyclic GMP elevation, confers selective cytoprotection against this oxidative component of cell death. In the current report we decided to study the effects of an NO donor, DETA-NONOate on H2 O2 -induced cell death in 1-week-old rat cortical neurones in primary culture, in order to investigate the role of NO as a neuroprotective agent in oxidative stress. We have used also used 1H -[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a ]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), as a specific and potent inhibitor of SGC (Garthwaite et al., 1995; Moro et al., 1996 ), and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS), as a specific inhibitor of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases (Butt et al., 1994; Smolenski et al., 1998 ), to determine whether these NO effects are dependent on cyclic GMP and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Primary culture of rat cortical neurones Primary cultures of cortical cells were prepared as described before (Fernández-Tomé and Segal, 1987; Moro et al., 1998 ). On day 4, the medium was changed to a defined medium (serum-free, chemically defined medium containing 30 nM selenite, 5 μg/ml insulin from bovine pancreas, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 20 nM progesterone and 100 μM putrescine in MEM), which was replaced twice weekly. Studies were performed at in vitro day 8, when the cultures consisted of ≥95% neurones (Moro et al., 1998 ). To expose the cells to the various agents, culture medium was replaced by MEM supplemented with 0.6% glucose, 0.029% glutamine and 16 mg/l gentamicin.  2.2 Cell treatments Cortical cells grown in 96-multiwell plates (50 000 cells/well) were treated at in vitro days 8–9. Dilutions of H2 O2  were made fresh from a 30% stock solution (V/V) into culture medium immediately before each experiment and exposures were performed within 5 min after dilution. In the first experiments, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 , 10–100 μM) for 30 min. In a different set of experiments, cells were incubated with the SGC inhibitor ODQ (1–10 μM), DMSO (a hydroxyl radical scavenger; 0.5%), the inhibitor of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (100 μM) or vehicle for 30 min. After this time, cells were treated with H2 O2  (20–40 μM) plus DETA-NONOate (0.1–30 μM) for 30 min. Except for H2 O2 , the other molecules were included both during and after H2 O2  treatment. Finally, in other experiments, cells treated with H2 O2  (20–40 μM, 30 min) were incubated with the membrane-permeable analogue of cyclic GMP 8-bromoguanosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cyclic GMP, 1 mM) and the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 100 μM). Cell viability was evaluated 6–24 h after the treatment without changing the medium unless indicated.  2.3 Viability studies Cell viability was monitored by the colourimetric MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay as previously described (Mosmann, 1983; Hansen et al., 1989 ). This method assesses mitochondrial activity by measuring the ability of cortical cultures to reduce MTT to a coloured formazan, using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). In all these assays, eight wells were used for each condition, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. In a previous study, we have shown that results from MTT assay in this preparation correlated well with other methods of quantifying cell viability such as morphological cell counting performed by Trypan Blue exclusion (Moro et al., 1998 ). Viability of control cultures as assessed with this method was unaffected during the duration of the experiment.  2.4 Cyclic GMP concentrations in cortical neurones Cortical neurones grown on 24-multiwell plates (0.3×106  cells/well) at in vitro day 8 were incubated for an additional period of 30 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of ODQ (1 μM) in fresh MEM containing IBMX (1 mM). They were then incubated, either alone or in the presence of H2 O2  (40 μM)±DETA-NONOate (1–3 μM) for 30 min. In all cases, the final volume was 300 μl. The incubation was stopped by aspiration of the medium and addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold ethanol. The cyclic GMP concentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA cyclic GMP assay kit, Amersham) following manufacturers instructions and absorbance was measured in a Molecular Devices microplate reader.  2.5 Reagents ODQ was from Alexis, DETA-NONOate was from Alexis, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS was from Biolog, cyclic GMP enzyme immunoassay was from Amersham and other reagents were from Sigma.  2.6 Statistics Results are mean±S.E.M. of at least 3 separate experiments. One-way ANOVAs were used to test for significant differences between group means. Post hoc analyses employed Newman–Keuls tests to establish significant differences, corresponding F  values are presented in each figure legend and P <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.   3 Results 3.1 Characterisation of H2 O2 -induced neurotoxicity in primary cortical cultures from rat brain Incubation of cortical neurones with H2 O2  (10–100 μM) resulted in a concentration-dependent neuronal death, which was detectable 6 h after the treatment. This toxic effect was maximal after 24 h (LC50 =41.8±1.9 μM; Fig. 1  ), as cell death caused by 100 μM H2 O2  after 48 h was not significantly different from that obtained at 24 h (data not shown). Therefore, cell viability studies were performed 24 h after the treatment. The neurotoxicity induced by 40 μM H2 O2  was reversed in the presence of DMSO (0.5%; 91.1±2.1% of control, n =3, P <0.05).  3.2 Effect of the NO donor DETA-NONOate on H2 O2 -induced neuronal death To study the effects of the NO donor DETA-NONOate on H2 O2 -induced neurotoxicity, the concentrations of H2 O2  used were 20 and 40 μM. The addition of 1–10 μM DETA-NONOate (P <0.01, n =3–8; Fig. 2  ), but not of lower concentrations (0.3 μM; P >0.05, n =3–4; Fig. 2 ) inhibited H2 O2 -induced neuronal death. These concentrations of DETA-NONOate did not have any effect per se on cell viability (data not shown).  3.3 Reversal by ODQ and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS of the neuroprotection caused by DETA-NONOate on H2 O2 -induced neurotoxicity To study the effects of ODQ and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS on DETA-NONOate-induced neuroprotective effects, the concentration of H2 O2  used was 40 μM. ODQ (1–10 μM) reversed the neuroprotective effect caused by DETA-NONOate (1–10 μM) on H2 O2 -induced neuronal death (P <0.01, n =3–5; Fig. 3  ). On the other hand, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (100 μM) also reversed the neuroprotective effect induced by 10 μM DETA-NONOate on H2 O2 -induced neurotoxicity (n =3, P <0.05; Fig. 4  ). These concentrations of ODQ or Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS by themselves did not affect cell viability (data not shown).  3.4 Effect of 8-Br-cyclic GMP on H2 O2 -induced neuronal death The decrease in cell viability caused by 30 and 40 μM H2 O2  was significantly reversed when cells were co-incubated in the presence of 8-Br-cyclic GMP (1 mM; Fig. 5  ; n =3, P <0.05). This compound did not affect per se cell viability (data not shown).  3.5 Effect of ODQ and H2 O2  on DETA-NONOate-induced increase in cyclic GMP The basal cyclic GMP concentration of cortical neurones (0.3±0.1 pmol/0.3×106  cells, n =6) was significantly inhibited by ODQ (1 μM, not detectable, n =3, P <0.05). Incubation of cortical cells for 30 min with 1 and 3 μM DETA-NONOate increased the cyclic GMP concentration to 2.3±0.4 and to 2.5±0.5 pmol/0.3×106  cells, respectively (n =3, Fig. 6  ). This increase was inhibited by ODQ (1 μM, n =3, Fig. 6 ). In addition, H2 O2  (40 μM) did not significantly affect either basal or stimulated cyclic GMP levels (n =3, P >0.05, Fig. 6 ).   4 Discussion Our results show that H2 O2  causes neurotoxicity in 1-week-old rat cortical neurones in primary culture and that the NO donor DETA-NONOate at concentrations in the low micromolar range inhibits this effect. This effect of DETA-NONOate is mimicked by the cyclic GMP analogue 8-Br-cyclic GMP and reversed by the selective inhibitor of SGC ODQ and the specific inhibitor of the cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS. This action of ODQ is parallel to the inhibition of the DETA-NONOate-induced increase in cyclic GMP concentrations and is reversed in the presence of 8-Br-cyclic GMP, which mimics the actions of cyclic GMP. H2 O2  caused a concentration-dependent neurotoxicity on rat cortical neurones, which was maximal 1 day after a 30-min period treatment. This effect was reversed in the presence of DMSO, suggesting that hydroxyl radical formation is involved in H2 O2 -induced neurotoxicity. The NO donor DETA-NONOate causes neuroprotection from H2 O2  (20 and 40 μM)-induced toxicity which is maximal at 1–3 μM. Direct antioxidant effects of the NO molecule might account for this neuroprotective effect, as it has been shown previously with neurotoxicity induced by different agents in which the hydroxyl radical is involved (Wink et al., 1993; Rauhala et al., 1996, 1998; Mohanakumar et al., 1998 ). However, we have shown that inhibition of SGC with ODQ reverses DETA-NONOate protective effects on H2 O2 -induced cell death suggesting that NO-induced cyclic GMP elevation plays a protective role against the mechanism causing cell death in these conditions. This was corroborated by: (1) the data showing that ODQ inhibits the increases in cyclic GMP induced by DETA-NONOate in cortical neurones in primary culture; and (2) the experiments in which 8-Br-cyclic GMP, a membrane-permeant cyclic GMP analogue, significantly inhibits H2 O2 -induced neurotoxicity. It has been suggested that part of the neuronal death caused by H2 O2  may be associated with increases in intracellular free calcium (Whittemore et al., 1995 ). This is consistent with our finding showing reversal of DETA-NONOate-induced neuroprotective effects by ODQ, since a general functional theme for cyclic GMP action through cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase is a lowering of intracellular calcium concentration (for a review, see Wang and Robinson, 1997 ). Supporting this theory, our data show that the reversal by ODQ of DETA-NONOate-induced inhibition of the toxicity caused by H2 O2  is similar to that achieved after incubation of the cells with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, an inhibitor of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, suggesting that the pathway affording protection involves activation of this kinase. This is in agreement with previous studies providing evidence that activation of cyclic GMP or cyclic GMP analogues can protect neurones against metabolic, excitotoxic and oxidative injury via a decrease in intraneuronal Ca2+  concentration caused by activation of K+  channels, which is mediated by a cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (Barger et al., 1995; Furukawa et al., 1996; Barger and Mattson, 1996 ). In this context, it has also been shown that the neuroprotective effect of somatostatin on NMDA-induced neuronal death is also mediated by cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, presumably by regulation of the intracellular calcium level (Forloni et al., 1997 ). Higher concentrations of DETA-NONOate did not afford any further protection in our preparation; some authors have suggested that the hydroxyl radical results from the interaction between NO and H2 O2  (Nappi and Vass, 1998 ), and this might counteract the neuroprotective effects that we have observed at lower concentrations. The activation of SGC is accepted to be the main target for NO actions (Ignarro, 1990; McDonald and Murad, 1996 ) and NO released from DETA-NONOate is likely to be responsible for cyclic GMP elevations. In addition, H2 O2  could be another candidate as it has been shown that this molecule is able to cause activation of SGC and accumulation of cyclic GMP (Burke-Wolin et al., 1991 ). However, H2 O2  did not cause any change in cyclic GMP levels in our system. In summary, our data show that H2 O2  causes neurotoxicity and that NO-induced cyclic GMP elevations exert a neuroprotective role against this damage in primary cultures of rat cortical neurones. In addition, pharmacological manipulation of the NO:cyclic GMP pathway may provide a therapy for neurodegenerative diseases in which oxidative stress is implicated, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson diseases, amyothrophic lateral sclerosis and disorders which include ischaemia and excitotoxicity (Coyle and Puttfarcken, 1993; Gutteridge, 1994; Bowling and Beal, 1995 ).
