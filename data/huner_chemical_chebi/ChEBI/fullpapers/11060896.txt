 Arachidonic acid (AA) is metabolized to form four different epoxides (namely 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, 14,15-EET) via the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase (epoxygenase) pathway [1] . 14,15-EET is found in the urine [2]  and produced by platelets and endothelial cells [3,4] . The occurrence of 14,15-EET and other EETs in tissues and various cell types leads to the hypothesis that these substances may be stored in cells by conjugative protein binding or by incorporation into membrane phospholipids (PL) [5] . The stored form of EETs can be released upon activation of specific phospholipase, for example, phospholipase A2  (PLA2 ) or phospholipase C (PLC), by neuronal, hormonal or chemical stimulation [6,7] . Of the various systems in which, epoxygenase and its epoxides (EETs) have studied, the kidney seems to be a major organ for production and action of the EETs. The main forms of EETs found in the kidney and in urine are 8,9- and 14,15-EET [2] . The levels of EETs in the kidney seemed to vary as a function of renal pathology [8–10] . In the kidney, certain EETs and their dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid metabolites (diols or DHETs) have prominent biological functions, such as: inhibition of Na+ /K+  ATPase [11]  and suppression of vasopressin (AVP) action on rabbit kidney cortical collecting duct (CCD) [9] . With our previous reports [12,13] , it is conceivable that 14,15-EET and its metabolite (14,15-DHET) may play an important role in maintaining blood pressure, modulating renal function, and regulating monocyte adhesion. In other systems, Malcolm and Fitzpatrick reported that 14,15-EET inhibited Ca+2  entry into cells [14] . We had shown that 14,15-EET can enhance monocyte attachment to endothelium and decrease the mean arterial blood pressure in normal and spontaneously hypertensive rats [12,13] . Catella et al. [15]  reported high amounts of 14,15-EET in the urine of patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension, suggesting a possible role of 14,15-EET in blood pressure regulation. These wide varieties of biological function suggest that 14,15-EET may act through specific receptors and signal transduction pathways. In this study, we have identified a population of specific high affinity binding sites for 14,15-EET in GPM cells that may be associated with receptors. This population of 14,15-EET binding sites in GPM cells was down regulated by cholera toxin or dibutyryl-cAMP that suggested a postreceptor mechanism coupled to PKA-dependent signal transduction pathway.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials White Hartley guinea pigs weighing 250 to 350 g were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY, USA). Percoll, HEPES, deoxyribonuclease, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, sodium bicarbonate (a cell culture grade), Tris-base, chymotrypsin (type IS and type II), papain, pronase E, proteinase K, and dibutyryl cAMP were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). The gelatin was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn, NJ, USA). H-89 and K252a were from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and horse serums were obtained from GIBCO (Grand Island, NY, USA), [3 H]-14,15-EET (100 Ci/mmole) and 14,15-EET was synthesized and purified by RP, reversed phase-HPLC, as previously described [16] .  2.2 Harvest and purification of guinea pig monocytes Female white Hartley guinea pigs (250–350 g) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.5 ml horse serum twice a week for 2 weeks, and afterwards, once weekly. After a minimum of 48 h from the last injection, the cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage. The animals were anesthetized with metofane and a 20 g × 2″ (Surflo) Teflon intercath was inserted into the peritoneal cavity. The cavity was washed with 20 ml of Hank’s buffered saline solution without calcium or magnesium (HBSS), containing 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 and 10 Units/ml of heparin. The collected cells were centrifuged at 275 × g  for 5 min, washed and resuspended in 4 ml of HBSS containing 10% gelatin and 5 mg deoxyribonuclease (HBSS-GD). Hypotonic lysis removed contaminating red blood cells. Four milliliters of aliquots of the cell suspension were layered on top of a Percoll density gradient and centrifuged at 1600 × g  for 30 min. The discontinuous density gradient was prepared by overlaying successive layers of 86%, 76%, 64%, and 45% isotonic Percoll containing 0.03 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease to give the following densities: A: 1.06, B: 1.08, C: 1.09, D: 1.10 g/ml [17,18] . The four bands of cells were collected at the interface of the different density layers, and to remove any remaining Percoll, each was diluted 1:4 with HBSS-GD, centrifuged, washed once, and resuspended in HBSS-GD. Differential counts were obtained using slide preparation stained with Diff Quick (American Scientific). From this procedure we could collect the lymphocytes and monocytes, A and B bands, respectively. Eosinophils were collected mainly from the C and D bands [17,18] . Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and found to be >99%.  2.3 Radioligand binding assays All assays were performed in duplicate with intact GPM cells suspended in HBSS buffer, pH 7.4 containing 10 mM CaCl2  and 10 mM MgCl2  at a final volume of 250 μl. In the saturation binding experiment, GPM cells (106  cells) were added to polypropylene tubes (12 × 75 mm) and incubated at 4°C for 4 min with increasing concentrations of [3 H]-14,15-EET (0.4 nM–30 nM) in the presence or absence of 20 μM unlabeled 14,15-EET. For nonsaturation experiments, 1000-fold excess of unlabeled 14,15-EET was used. Bound and free [3 H]-14,15-EET were separated by centrifugation at 2000 rev./min, 4°C for 2 min. Pellets were washed with 250 μl of HBSS twice and centrifuged at 2000 rev./min, 4°C for 2 min. Pellets were taken up in 200 μl 20% NaOH, heated on 40°C water bath with constant shaking, and then taken up in 4.8 ml of scintillation liquid. The radioactivity was measured by a Beckman 7500 Scintillation Counter after equilibration for 13 to 18 h in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The competition studies of [3 H]14,15-EET specific binding to guinea pig mononuclear cells was conducted by incubating GPM cells (106  cells) with 2 nM of [3 H] 14,15-EET in the presence of various concentrations (10−11  to 10−4  M) of stereo isomers and analogs of 14,15-EET. For the experiments on the effects of proteases (chymotrypsin, papain, pronase E, and Proteinase K), cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, dibutyryl cAMP, and H-89 on [3 H]-14,15-EET binding to GPM cells, the cells were pretreated with one of the following group of agents: 1) proteases (chymotrypsin-type IS and type II, papain, pronase E and proteinase K, 100 μg/ml) at 37°C for 20 min; 2) cholera toxin (25–200 μg/ml) and pertussis toxin (20–200 ng/ml) at 37°C for 2 h; 3) dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) (10–100 nM) at 37°C for 30 min; 4) H-89 (0.01–1 μm) at 37°C for 10 min, then in the presence of DBcAMP (100 nM) at 37°C for another 30 min, separately before the binding assay. The pretreated GPM cells were centrifuged at 1000 rev./min, at 4°C for 5 min, washed with HBSS buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in HBSS before the binding assay.  2.4 cAMP and cGMP determination GPM cells (4 × 106 ) were preincubated with or without 400 μM of IBMX for 5 min before the addition of 14,15-EET (0.1–100 μM). The assays were incubated for another 10 min at 37°C and terminated by addition of ethanol (its final concentration was 65%). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was dried under vacuum and redissolved in 0.05 M acetate buffer for further determination of cAMP and cGMP by RIA kit (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL, USA).  2.5 Statistical analysis Experimental results were summarized as mean values ± SEM. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA through the Sigma stat program (Jandel Scientific). Difference between groups was then determined using the Bonferroni’s t -test. When the test of the normality failed, Dunn’s test of ANOVA by ranks was used. Groups were deemed to be significantly different from one another when P  < 0.05.   3 Results 3.1 Binding of [3 H]- 14,15-EET to GPM cells The binding of [3 H]- 14,15-EET to GPM cells was time dependent and cell concentration dependent (Fig. 1A and B) .   Maximum binding at 4°C was reached at 4 min with the cell density of 2 × 106  cells/ml. Cell bound [3 H]- 14,15-EET was readily dissociated in a time-dependent fashion when 1000-fold higher concentration of unlabeled of 14(R ), 15(S )-EET, or 14(S ), 15(R )-EET was added to the reaction mixture with 14(R ),15(S )-EET more effective than the 14(S ),15(R )-EET (Fig. 2) .   The displacement of bound radioligand reached maximum (66%) in 5 min after the addition of unlabeled 14(R), 15(S)-EET. The saturability of the specific [3 H]- 14,15-EET was shown by incubating the GPM cells with increasing concentrations of radioligand in the presence or absence of 20 μM unlabeled 14,15-EET. As shown in Fig. 3A ,   [3 H]-14,15-EET binding to GPM cells was saturable and of high affinity. Nonspecific binding increased linearly with increasing concentration of ligand. Total binding also increased with increasing concentration of [3 H]- 14,15-EET. This showed that nonspecific binding was of high capacity, nonsaturable and low affinity whereas specific binding was of low capacity, saturable, and high affinity. Scatchard analysis of specific [3 H]-14,15-EET binding to GPM cells (Fig. 3B)  shows that the [3 H]- 14,15-EET binding sites in GPM cells belong to a high affinity population. The dissociation constant (K d ) is 35.06 ± 1.73 nM (n  = 4), and the maximum number of binding sites (B max ) was estimated to be 2.36 ± 0.31 pmol/106  cells and the number of binding sites per cell calculated to be 1.42 ± 0.19 × 106  sites/cell (n  = 4).  3.2 Competition studies of [3 H]14,15-EET specific binding to guinea pig mononuclear cells by 14,15-EET stereoisomers and other EETs To examine the specificity of the binding sites for [3 H]14,15-EET, we conducted competition binding studies with stereoisomers and analogs of 14,15-EET and other EETs. As shown in Fig. 4 ,   14(R ), 15(S )-EET was an effective competing ligand with a K i  of 226.3 nM followed by 11(R ),12(S )-EET, 14(S ),15(R )-EET, 14,15 thia(S )-ET, and 14,15-aza(N )-ET with K i  of 595.1 nM, 612.5 nM, 3.54 μM, and 5 μM, respectively.  3.3 Effects of protease enzymes on [3 H]-14,15-EET binding on GPM cells Preincubation of the intact GPM cells with 100 μg/ml of various protease enzymes such as: chymotrypsin-type IS and type II, papain, pronase E, and proteinase K at 37°C for 20 min led to significant reduction of binding (n  = 3) (Fig. 5) .   Papain produced the most reduction (51.60%) on the binding of [3 H]-14,15-EET to its receptor followed by proteinase K (47.14%), chymotrypsin-type II (42.04%), chymotrypsin-type IS (27.33%), and pronase E (15.98%), respectively. These data suggest that 14,15-EET binding sites of the intact GPM cells are protein in nature.  3.4 Effects of cholera toxin and pertussis toxin on [3 H]-14,15-EET binding on GPM cells The effects of cholera toxin and pertussis toxin, agents known to enhance cAMP levels, were tested on [3 H]-14,15-EET in GPM cells. GPM cells were pretreated with cholera toxin (25–200 μg/ml) and pertussis toxin (20–200 ng/ml) separately at 37°C for 2 h, followed by radioligand binding assay. 14,15-EET receptor binding was decreased 58.99 ± 6.37% by cholera toxin (200 μg/ml) (Fig. 6A)   and 40.50 ± 3.78% by pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml) (data not shown). Thus, agents that increase intracellular cAMP level can effectively down regulate 14,15-EET receptor binding. The down regulation of [3 H]- 14,15-EET binding in GPM cells by cholera toxin (200 μg/ml) is shown by the decrease of number of binding sites (B max , 32.0% decrease) on the cell surface without changing the dissociation constant (K d ) (Fig. 6B) .  3.5 Effects of dibutyryl cAMP on [3 H]-14,15-EET binding on GPM cells We pretreated GPM cells with various concentrations of dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) at 37°C for 30 min followed by the radioligand binding assays as described. Similar to the effect of cholera toxin, a significant reduction of specific binding (>35% reduction) for [3 H] 14,15-EET was observed after the cells were treated with DBcAMP. The reduction of [3 H]-14,15-EET binding to GPM cells was dose-dependent with respect to DBcAMP (Fig. 7A)   and maximum response was reached at 100 nM. Scatchard analysis revealed that the number of the [3 H]-14,15-EET binding sites (B max ) in GPM cell surface was decreased by 19.1% after incubation with 100 nM of DBcAMP without changing the K d (Fig. 7B)  in the same fashion as the treatment with cholera toxin.  3.6 Effect of protein kinase inhibitors on the reduction of [3 H]-14,15-EET binding in GPM cells by DBcAMP Because pretreatment of GPM cells with DBcAMP or cholera toxin resulted in the down regulation of 14,15-EET binding site density, we further examined whether this effect was due to activation of PKA. GPM cells were incubated with various concentrations of PKA inhibitor, H-89 [19] , at 37°C for 10 min before the pretreatment of DBcAMP (100 nM) at 37°C for an 30 min. The cells were washed with HBSS once and resuspended in HBSS. Low doses of H-89 (0.01 μM) alone showed a slightly decrease in [3 H]-14,15-EET binding but a higher dose (0.1–1.0 μM) showed significant increases as compared with controls (untreated GPM cells). However, when GPM cells were pretreated with H-89 from 0.1 to 1.0 μM before treatment with DBcAMP, H-89 readily reversed the down regulatory response of DBcAMP on [3 H]-14,15-EET binding in GPM cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8) .   Under similar conditions, K252a (a protein kinase C inhibitor) could not reverse the downward regulatory effect of DBcAMP on [3 H]-14,15-EET binding in GPM cells.  3.7 Effects of 14,15-EET on the level of cAMP and cGMP in intact GPM cells Because cholera toxin and cAMP both are able to down regulate the 14,15-EET receptor binding, the effects of 14,15-EET on the intracellular levels of cAMP or cGMP were examined. GPM cells were preincubated with or without 400 μM of IBMX for 5 min at 37°C and incubated with various concentrations of 14,15-EET (0.01–100 μM) for additional 10 min. We found that 14,15-EET can indeed induce an increase of intracellular level of cAMP in GPM cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 to 100 μM) (Fig. 9) .   Maximal effect on the increase of cAMP in GPM cells required the presence of IBMX, a phospodiesterase inhibitor. When the cells were pretreated with 100 μM of 14,15-EET, there was a nearly 12-fold increase in intracellular level of cAMP, from 2.67 pmol/106  cells (without 14,15-EET) to 32.42 pmol/106  cells (pretreated with 100 μM of 14,15-EET). However, under similar conditions, 14,15-EET had no effect on the levels of cGMP in GPM cells in the presence of IBMX.   4 Discussion 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET) was originally found to produce by platelets and subsequently by endothelial cells [3,4] . Our earlier data showed that a profound increase in EET (especially 14,15-EET) generation in endothelial cells (EC) after exposure to 240 mg/dl low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Subsequent data showed that 14,15-EET induced an 8-fold increase of U-937 cell adhesion to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as compared with non-treated control [13] . These results support the notion that 14,15-EET may mediate the atherogenic LDL induced enhancement of U-937 cells’ adhesion on HUVEC [20] . Because endothelial cells derived from human umbilical veins (HUVE) do not possess any specific binding for [3 H]-14,15-EET that suggested a lack of 14,15-EET receptors in endothelium [21,22] , the enhancement of monocyte adhesion by 14,15-EET may act through a receptor and the activation of a signal transduction mechanism in monocytes. In this report, we have identified and characterized a population of specific high affinity binding sites for [3 H]-14,15-EET in GPM cells and found the ligand binding is high affinity with a K d  of 35.06 ± 1.73 nM and B max  of 2.36 ± 0.32 pmol/106  cells. The calculated number of binding sites per cell was 1.42 ± 0.19 × 106  sites/cell. This binding site is stereospecific for 14(R ), 15(S )-EET and has less affinity toward other EETs and 11(R ), 12(S )-EET (Fig. 4) . The binding of [3 H]-14,15-EET to GPM cells is reversible (Fig. 2)  and protease sensitive which showed that this binding site is associated with a protein species (Fig. 5) . The rapid time course of radioligand binding in the cold temperature and the reversibility suggested that the binding be not likely due to the esterification of 14,15-EET into the membrane phospholipids. 14,15-EET binding in GPM cells is attenuated by cholera toxin or pertussis toxin without changing the dissociation constant (K d ). Because both cholera toxin and pertussis toxin activate adenyl cyclase and report to increase intracellular cAMP [23] , we found that addition of dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP) can reduce the binding of [3 H]- 14,15-EET on GPM cells in a dose-dependent manner by reducing the cell surface receptor density (B max ) without changing the dissociation constant (K d ) (Fig. 7A and B) . However pertussis toxin was less effective as compared with cholera toxin probably due to the fact it is less effective in increasing intracellular cAMP level in GPM cells. These results suggest that the reagents that elevated intracellular cAMP levels in GPM cells down regulate 14,15-EET binding and the binding sites are likely associated with a functional receptor. The fact that the down regulation of 14,15-EET receptor binding induced by cAMP can be reversed by a PKA inhibitor, H-89, further suggest these processes may be mediated through the activation of PKA linked signal transduction pathway. The high concentration (μM range) of 14,15-EET required to increase the level of cAMP possibly due to phosphodiesterase in GPM cells being active that cAMP could not accumulate even in the presence of IBMX. Another possibility is due to GPM cells that might have different types of phosphodiesterase that IBMX cannot effectively inhibit. Although it seems clear that 14,15-EET transduction system involves cAMP mediation and a PKA-dependent mechanism, the precise details of the process, i.e. whether down regulation is secondary to phosphorylation of receptor protein or by internalization require further investigation.
