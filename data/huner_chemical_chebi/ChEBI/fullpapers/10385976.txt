 3-Deoxy-d -glycero -d -galacto -2-nonulosonic acid (Kdn) is a unique deaminated analogue of sialic acid that has recently been isolated from the rainbow trout egg polysialoglycoprotein (PSGP) [1] . Kdn has several forms of glycosylic linkages, such as α-(2→3), α-(2→6) and α-(2→8) and has been found in a variety of tissues such as fish egg, sperm, amphibian egg, and bacteria [2–5] . To date, in order to investigate the role of the Kdn, several studies have been carried out [6] , and consequently, it was deduced that the Kdn may play a role in protecting against sialidase digestion [6] . In order to investigate its further roles, enzymatic incorporation of Kdn and its analogues into intact oligosaccharides in vivo is a potential method as has been demonstrated in the research on N -acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) [7] . Although activities of Kdn-transferase have been identified [6] , purification of Kdn-transferase has not been accomplished on a practical scale. On the other hand, a variety of sialyltransferases have been purified and used in enzymatic syntheses of sialoside, its analogues [8] , and Kdn-α-(2→3)-Gal-β-(1→4)-Glc-β-1-OAll [9] . Recently, bacterial α-(2→6) sialyltransferase [EC 2.4.99.1], which catalyzes the transfer of NeuAc to a variety of sialyl acceptors, has been isolated [10] . Since this enzyme has broad substrate specificity [11] , it is expected to be useful for the syntheses of Kdn oligosaccharides or their analogues. If this enzyme can transfer Kdn from CMP-β-d -Kdn to the corresponding sialyl acceptor, modification of oligosaccharide by Kdn or its analogues in vivo will be developed. We report here enzymatic transfer of Kdn to methyl N -acetyl-β-d -lactosaminide and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d -lactoside by bacterial α-(2→6)-sialyltransferase.  2 . Results and discussion CMP-β-d -Kdn was prepared by our previously reported method (Scheme 1  ) [12] . This synthetic route, however, afforded a mixture of four isomers of 4 . The derivatives were rationalized as 1:1:0.8:0.8, and this ratio is reproducible. 1 H NMR data suggested that the phosphite derivatives consist of an anomeric mixture of Kdn because both H-3′ and H-4′ in the Kdn unit were observed with reasonable chemical shifts (Table 2 in Ref. [13] ). Since separation of each product proved to be difficult due to their lability on purification, the phosphite 4  was then used in the next step without further purification. Oxidation of 4  also afforded a mixture of four kinds of phosphate 5  in 88% yield. After deprotection, the 1 H NMR spectrum of the crude product showed that the desired CMP-β-d -Kdn 6  was obtained in 60% purity, and no CMP-α-d -Kdn was observed at all. These results indicated that CMP-α-d -Kdn might be more labile than 6 . Purification with a gel-permeation column (5 mM NH4 OH) afforded pure compound 6  in 30% yield, and its 1 H NMR data are in good agreement with reported data [4,9,14] . Enzymatic synthesis of Kdn-oligosaccharide 8  using the bacterial α-(2→6)-sialyltransferase was performed under the reported conditions [11]  for the preparation of sialoside, except that the pH was adjusted to 7.5. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of Kdn to methyl β-d -N -acetyllactosaminide (7 ) and afforded the desired Kdn-N -acetyl-β-d -lactosaminide 8  in 77% yield (Scheme 2  ). The structure was identified by 1 H and related 2D NMR spectra. Enzyme assay using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d -lactoside indicated that the apparent K m  value of CMP-β-d -Kdn is 880 μM, which is 27 times larger than that of CMP-β-d -NeuAc (33 μM). In addition, the V max  value of CMP-β-d -Kdn is 15% larger than that of CMP-β-d -NeuAc. Despite the fact that substitution of the acetamido group with a hydroxyl group resulted in a decrease of both binding affinity and transfer velocity, practical enzymatic synthesis could still afford Kdn-N -acetyl-β-d -lactosaminide in good yield. In general, mammalian α-(2→6)-sialyltransferase cannot catalyze transfer of NeuAc to both lactose and N -acetyl-β-d -lactosamine. However, bacterial sialyltransferase can transfer even Kdn to both lactose and N -acetyl-β-d -lactosamine. This finding would be useful for the synthesis of several Kdn oligosaccharides. In summary, we found bacterial sialyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of Kdn to both methyl N -acetyl-β-d -lactosaminide and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d -lactoside. A previous report [11,15]  showed that this enzyme has broad substrate specificity toward disaccharides and monosaccharides. In addition, the enzyme is now available in large quantity [15] . Therefore, enzymatic synthesis using CMP-modified-Kdn and bacterial sialyltransferase would afford Kdn-oligosaccharide analogues which can be expected to clarify the role of Kdn. Since the Kdn may be resistant to sialidase digestion, the Kdn or its analogues will be expected to be used for masking of galactosides at the nonreducing end of the glycoprotein in order to change the biological response, such as blocking the hepatic clearance [16] .  3 .
