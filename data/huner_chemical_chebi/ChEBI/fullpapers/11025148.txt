 Malaria is still the most important parasitic disease in the world, causing 2–3 million deaths every year (WHO, 1997 ). The rising resistance of Plasmodium  spp., especially Plasmodium falciparum , to known antimalarials such as chloroquine makes the search for new antimalarial drugs increasingly important. Therefore, we investigated several medicinal plants, which are traditionally used as antimalarial or antipyretic remedies by the indigenous population in Latin America (Duke, 1975; Hirschhorn, 1981; Joly et al., 1987; Gupta et al., 1993 ). During a screening program, we obtained lipophilic and hydrophilic extracts of these plants with antiplasmodial activity and we selected the most active ones for further investigation (Jenett-Siems et al., 1999 ). Andira inermis  (W. Wright) H.B.K. (Fabaceae) is a tall tree characterised by a thick trunk and red-purple flowers, native from southern Mexico to northern South America. As a febrifuge, the bark is boiled in milk, sweetened water or performed in pills. It is also used as a purgative, vermifuge, or for dermal irritations. The seeds have similar uses. Large doses of the stem bark or seeds caused vomiting and violent diarrhoea; in some cases they were even fatal (Hirschhorn, 1981; Morton, 1981 ). From this species, several isoflavones and related structures have been reported (Cocker et al., 1962; Lock de Ugaz et al., 1991 ). The lipophilic extracts of stems and leaves showed moderate in vitro activity against P. falciparum  in this screening program and were further analysed by bioassay-guided fractionation to isolate the active compounds.  2 Material and methods 2.1 General For fractionation, silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh) was utilised. Preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Knauer Eurochrom 2000 equipped with a Nucleosil P 300 C-18 (10 μm) column. Mass spectra were determined with a Finnigan MAT CH7A (220°C, ionisation 70 eV) and 1 H-NMR spectra were obtained using acetone-D6  as a solvent with a Bruker AVANCE DPX 400 (400 MHz, TMS as internal standard). The erythrocytes were harvested with an Inotech cell harvester and the β-radiation of the incorporated [3 H]hypoxanthine was measured with a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta plus liquid scintillation counter.  2.2 Plant material Leaves and stems of A. inermis  were collected in the area of Panama City (at the road El Llano-Carti), Panama, during March 1997. Voucher specimens (FLORPAN 2758) were identified by Professor M.D. Correa A. and deposited at the Herbarium of the University of Panama.  2.3 Extraction and isolation In the screening program, the air-dried stem bark and leaves (20 g) were extracted three times for 2 h with 150 ml petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (1:1) at room temperature. Then the plant material was air dried again and treated three times with 150 ml methanol/water (8:2) to yield the hydrophilic extracts. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure at 40°C. For further investigations, the crushed stems (600 g) were air dried and extracted three times with 2 l of petroleum ether/ethyl acetate (1:1) for 24 h at room temperature. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure at 40°C. The oily residue (3.3 g) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel 60 (45 g) and eluted with cyclohexane, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate mixtures, and methanol to yield seven fractions, which were tested against P. falciparum . Fraction 5 and 6, which were eluted with cyclohexane/ethyl acetate (8:2 and 7:3, respectively), proved to be most active. Further separation of fraction 5 (150 mg) by HPLC at a 5 ml/min flow rate of methanol/water (55:45) yielded the compounds 1  (2.4 mg), 2  (6.1 mg), and 3  (6.6 mg). Fraction 6 was separated with methanol/water (45:55) to give the compounds 4  (8.3 mg), 5  (8.5 mg), and 6  (1.6 mg). Compound 2  (prunetin): EI-MS: m /z  (rel. int.)=284 (M+ , 100), 166 (35), 138 (22), 118 (15), 110 (10), 95 (13); 1 H-NMR (400 MHz, acetone-D6 ): δ  (ppm)=3.93 (3 H, s, CH3 O-7), 6.36 (1 H, d, J =2.3 Hz, H-6), 6.55 (1 H, d, J =2.4 Hz, H-8), 6.91 (2 H, d, J =8.5 Hz, H-3′,5′), 7.47 (2 H, d, J =8.5 Hz, H-2′,6′), 8.22 (1 H, s, H-2), 13.4 (1 H, s, OH-5).  2.4 Antiplasmodial bioassay In this study, the chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. falciparum  poW (IC50 =0.015 μM) and the chloroquine-resistant clone Dd2 (IC50 =0.14 μM) were used. They were maintained in continuous culture in human red blood cells (A+ ) diluted to 5% haematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM Hepes, 30 mM NaHCO3 , and 10% human A+  serum. Crude extracts and isolated compounds were dissolved in DMSO (1 mg/50 μl) and diluted in RPMI 1640 medium (Trager and Jensen, 1976 ). The tests were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Desjardins et al., 1979 ) which contained 150 μl of a parasitized red blood suspension (A+ , 2.5% haematocrit, 0.5% parasitaemia). The samples were added to give final concentrations between 1.56 and 100 μg/ml. After incubation in a candle jar for 24 h, 0.5 μCi [3 H]hypoxanthine (1 mCi/ml, ICN) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for another 18 h. Incorporation of [3 H]hypoxanthine was measured by liquid scintillation after harvesting the cells on glass fibre filters with the cell harvester. All tests were performed in triplicate. The percentage of growth inhibition was calculated as follows: (1−[cpm in drug treated cultures/cpm in untreated cultures])×100. The concentration at which growth was inhibited by 50% (IC50 ) was estimated by interpolation. Extracts with IC50  values above 50 μg/ml were considered to be inactive (O'Neill et al., 1985 ).   3 Results The isolated compounds 1–6  (Fig. 1  ) turned out to be isoflavones. Compound 1 , isolated from both stems and leaves was identified as formononetin by comparison with an authentic sample. According to the spectral data (1 H-NMR, EI-MS), compound 2  proved to be prunetin. To the best of our knowledge, no 1 H-NMR values for prunetin have been published so far, therefore they are given in Section 2.3 . The isoflavones 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6  were identified as biochanin A, calycosin, genistein, and pratensein, respectively, by comparison of 1 H-NMR and EI-MS with published data (Asres et al., 1985; Kobayashi et al., 1985 ). Prunetin (2) , calycosin (4) , and pratensein (6)  were detected for the first time from the genus Andira . The lipophilic extracts of A. inermis  exhibited IC50  values from 56.0 μg/ml (leaves) to 108.7 μg/ml (stems) against P. falciparum  in vitro (Table 1  ). The hydrophilic extracts proved to be inactive. For all tested substances the antiparasitic activity against the chloroquine-sensitive strain poW was higher (factor two) than against the chloroquine-resistant clone Dd2. Calycosin (IC50  4.2 μg/ml for poW; 9.8 μg/ml for Dd2) and genistein (IC50  2.0 μg/ml for poW; 4.1 μg/ml for Dd2) proved to be most active. The other four compounds were considered to be inactive.  4 Discussion Although the lipophilic extracts of A. inermis  showed only moderate antiplasmodial activity compared to those known for other plant remedies (O'Neill et al., 1985; Jenett-Siems et al., 1999 ) they afforded two active isoflavones. This is the first report on antiplasmodial activity of isoflavones against P. falciparum . The low concentration of calycosin and genistein (<0.01% w/w) may be the explanation for the low antiplasmodial activity of the crude extract. It is known that calycosin also proved to be active against Giardia intestinalis , a potent protozoan agent for enteric diseases (ElSohly et al., 1999 ). During the preparation of this paper a patent application was published (Khan et al., 1999 ), which claimed a method of treating giardiasis and/or malaria comprising the use of isoflavones, but mentioning no data, proving their antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum . In our study, we have focused on the investigation of the lipophilic extract. The indigenous population, e.g. in Brazil (Morton, 1981 ), prefer to boil the stem bark with milk. This procedure covers the bitter taste and probably causes the extraction of lipophilic constituents. Interestingly, hydrophilic extracts (methanol/water 8:2) from A. inermis  did not show antiplasmodial activity in our test system. The evaluation of extracts obtained with water or milk is still in progress and might be interesting with regard to the ethnobotanical use of this species.
