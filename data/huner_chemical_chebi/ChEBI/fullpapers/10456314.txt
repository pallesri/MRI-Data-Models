 Enterobacteria of the genus Proteus  are a common cause of urinary tract infections in human, which often result in severe complications, such as pyelonephritis and formation of bladder and kidney stones [1] . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) is considered as one of the virulence factors of Proteus  which, after being released from bacterial cells, mediates the infectious processes [1,2] . The LPS consists of three moieties: a lipid part (lipid A) which anchors LPS into the outer membrane and is responsible for the endotoxicity of the LPS, an oligosaccharide core region, and an O-specific polysaccharide chain (OPS, O-antigen) which defines the immunospecificity of the bacterium. On the basis of the O-antigens, strains of Proteus  are classified serologically into more than 60 serogroups [3–5] . A serological cross-reactivity was observed for strains of different serogroups [5] , thus showing that the existing serogrouping scheme does not reflect all, but major, antigenic relationships between Proteus  strains. Immunochemical studies of LPSs are important for substantiation of the serological cross-reactivity of strains on the molecular level and for improvement of the classification of Proteus  on the chemical basis. In the LPSs of most Proteus  strains studied, the OPSs are acidic due to the presence of various acidic sugars and non-sugar components; a few strains of Proteus vulgaris  and Proteus penneri  have neutral OPSs [5] . Now, we report the structures of the OPSs of two serologically cross-reactive strains of Proteus mirabilis  belonging to serogroups O24 and O29. Strains of these serogroups are frequent among isolates from clinical specimens [3]  and were confirmed in this work to play a role in human pathology. Immunochemical studies of the OPSs and LPSs were performed in order to reveal the epitope specificity of the cross-reactive anti-LPS antibodies. Part of the data of P. mirabilis  O24 has been reported [6] .  2 Material and methods 2.1 Bacterial strains, isolation and degradation of the LPSs P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 (strains PrK 47/57 and 52/57, respectively) came from the Czech National Collection of Type Cultures (Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Prague). The LPSs were isolated using the phenol-water procedure [7]  and purified by treatment with DNAse and RNAse (Sigma, USA) and ultracentrifugation as described [7,8] . The isolated LPSs were essentially free of nucleic acids and contained <2% proteins. Delipidation of the LPSs was performed with aqueous 2% acetic acid at 100°C, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (13 000×g , 20 min), and the supernatant was fractionated on a column (2.5×65 cm) of Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia, Sweden) in 0.05 M pyridinium acetate buffer pH 4.5 with monitoring by a Knauer differential refractometer (Germany) to give the corresponding high molecular mass OPS and core oligosaccharide fractions. Alkali-treated LPSs were prepared by saponification of the LPSs with aqueous 0.25 M NaOH (56°C, 2 h). Smith degradation of the alkali-treated LPS from P. mirabilis  O24 was performed with 0.1 M NaIO4  (20°C, 48 h, in the dark), the resultant product was reduced with NaBH4  and desalted on Sephadex G-50.  2.2 NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer for a solution in D2 O at 30 or 60°C using internal acetone (δH  2.225, δC  31.45) as reference. Standard Bruker software (XWINNMR 1.2) was used to acquire and maintain the NMR data. A mixing time of 200 and 100 ms was used in two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY experiments with P. mirabilis  O29 OPS, respectively, or 300 ms in a NOESY experiment with P. mirabilis  O24 OPS. The 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectra were assigned using two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, and H-detected 1 H,13 C heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments. The assignment of β-linked sugars was confirmed making use of intraresidue H1/H3, H5 correlations revealed by a NOESY experiment. Spin systems of monosaccharides were identified based on the typical 3 J H,H  coupling constant values. Amino sugars were distinguished by correlations of protons at carbons bearing nitrogen to the corresponding carbons at δ 50–57, which were revealed by a 1 H,13 C HMQC experiment.  2.3 Sugar analysis The OPSs were hydrolyzed with 2 M CF3 COOH (120°C, 2 h) or methanolyzed with 1 M HCl/MeOH (80°C, 16 h). Amino sugars were identified on a Biotronik LC-2000 amino acid analyser (Germany) equipped with a column (0.4×22 cm) of a Ostion LG AN B cation-exchange resin using 0.35 M sodium citrate buffer pH 5.28 at 80°C. Neutral sugars were analysed with a Biotronik LC-2000 sugar analyser, using a column (0.4×15 cm) of a Dionex A×8–11 anion-exchange resin and 0.5 M sodium borate buffer pH 8.0 at 65°C. Uronic acids were analysed by GLC as acetylated methyl glycosides using a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 chromatograph with an Ultra 2 capillary column and a temperature gradient of 160°C (1 min) to 290°C at 10°C/min. The absolute configurations of monosaccharides were determined by GLC of acetylated (S )-2-butyl glycosides according to the published method [9,10]  modified as described [11] .  2.4 Preparation of sera and serological assays Rabbit antisera against surface heat-stabile antigens of Proteus  were obtained as described [12] . Briefly, a New Zealand rabbit received i.v. increasing doses of heat killed bacteria on days 0, 4, 7 and 11. On day 15, 20 ml blood was taken by cardiac puncture and early serum was prepared. After a single booster injection on day 50, the rabbit was extinguished on day 58 to give late serum. Unless stated otherwise, the data of early serum are given. Human sera were collected from healthy individuals or hospitalised patients who gave informed consent. ELISA and passive hemolysis (PH) were performed essentially as described [12] . In ELISA, human or rabbit sera were dispensed to plates containing antigens (LPS or Proteus  whole cells), and fixed antibodies were quantified with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human or anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Proteinase K- (Sigma) treated whole bacterial cells or LPSs were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli [13] . The gels were silver-stained according to Tsai and Frasch [14]  or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose plates (Shleicher and Schull, Germany), which were incubated with diluted (1:100) immune rabbit sera as primary antibodies and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as secondary antibodies [15] .   3 Results and discussion 3.1 Elucidation of the structure of the OPS of P. mirabilis  O24 Sugar analysis of the OPS after full acid hydrolysis, including determination of the absolute configurations of monosaccharides, revealed 2-amino-2-deoxy-D -glucose and 2-amino-2-deoxy-D -galactose in the ratio 2:1, as well as D -galactose. The 13 C-NMR spectrum of the OPS [6]  (Table 1 ) contained signals for four anomeric carbons in the region δ 102.5–106.6, three carbons linked to nitrogen (C2 of hexosamines) in the region δ 53.0–56.2, four HOC H2 -C groups (C6 of galactose and hexosamines) at δ 61.4–62.4, 13 other sugar ring carbons in the region δ 69.9–82.8, and three N -acetyl groups at δ 23.6–23.9 (CH3 ) and δ 175.4–175.7 (CO). Accordingly, the 1 H-NMR spectrum of the OPS (Table 1 ) contained, inter alia, signals for four anomeric protons in the region δ 4.44–4.91 and three N -acetyl groups at δ 2.04 (6H) and 2.09 (3H). Therefore, the OPS is composed of tetrasaccharide repeating units containing one residue each of D -galactose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D -glucose, and two residues of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D -galactose. Relatively large coupling constant values of J 1,2  7–8 Hz, determined from the 1 H-NMR spectrum of the OPS, showed that all monosaccharide residues are in the pyranose form and β-linked. In the 13 C-NMR spectrum of the OPS, the positions of the signals for C2–C6 of Gal at δ 72.2, 74.2, 69.9, 76.1, and 62.4 (or 62.0), respectively, were close to those of non-substituted β-Galp [16]  and, hence, Gal occupies the terminal position in the side chain. As a result of the glycosylation, the signals for C4 of one of the GlcNAc residues (GlcNAcI ), C3 of the other residue (GlcNAcII ), C3 and C4 of GalNAc were shifted downfield to δ 81.0, 82.8, 81.8, and 75.6, respectively, compared to their positions in the spectra of the corresponding non-substituted monosaccharides [16] . These data showed that the OPS is branched and allowed determination of the positions of substitution of the monosaccharides. The NOESY spectrum of the OPS contained interresidue cross-peaks between the following protons: Gal H1/GalNAc H3 (strong) and H4 (weak), GalNAc H1/GlcNAcI  H4, GlcNAcI  H1/GlcNAcII  H3, and GlcNAcII  H1/GalNAc H4 (strong), H3 and H5 (both weak). These data confirmed the positions of substitution of the monosaccharide residues, showed that GlcNAcII  and Gal are attached to GalNAc at positions 4 and 3, respectively, and allowed determination of the full monosaccharide sequence in the repeating unit. Therefore, the OPS of P. mirabilis  O24, which is the first neutral OPS found in this species, has the following structure:     3.2 Elucidation of the structure of the OPS of P. mirabilis  O29 Sugar analysis showed the presence of 2-amino-2-deoxy-D -galactose and D -glucuronic acid (D -GlcA) as components of the OPS. The 13 C-NMR spectrum of the OPS (Fig. 1, Table 1 ) was typical of a regular polymer. It contained signals for four anomeric carbons at δ 96.2–105.0, three HOC H2 -C groups (C6 of GalN) at δ 61.9, three carbons bearing nitrogen (C2 of GalN) at δ 50.5, 51.5 and 53.8, 13 other sugar ring carbons at δ 68.6–81.5, and N -acetyl groups (CH3  at δ 23.6, CO at δ 175.2–176.2). Accordingly, the 1 H-NMR spectrum (Table 1 ) contained signals for four anomeric protons at δ 4.52–5.08, other signals of sugar ring protons at δ 3.41–4.44, and three N -acetyl groups at δ 2.06–2.10. Therefore, the OPS has a tetrasaccharide repeating unit containing three residues of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D -galactose and one residue of D -glucuronic acid. The coupling constant value of J 1,2  3 Hz indicated that one of the GalNAc residues (GalNAcI ) is α-linked, whereas the values of J 1,2  8 Hz showed that GlcA and two other GalNAc residues (GalNAcII  and GalNAcIII ) are β-linked. The NOESY spectrum showed GalNAcIII  H1/GalNAcII  H4 and GalNAcII  H1/GlcA H4 interresidue cross-peaks, thus demonstrating a GalNAcIII (1→4)GalNAcII (1→4)GlcA sequence. H1 of GalNAcI  gave two interresidue cross-peaks, with H3 and H4 of GalNAcII , that is typical of α-(1→3)-linked disaccharides with the same absolute configuration of the constituent monosaccharides [17] . Likewise, H1 of GlcA gave two cross-peaks with H3 and H4 of GalNAcIII . In the 13 C-NMR spectrum of the OPS, the positions of the signals for C2–C6 of GalNAcI  at δ 50.5, 68.6, 69.4, 72.1, and 61.9, respectively, were typical of the non-substituted α-Galp NAc [16] . Relatively low-field positions of the signals for C3 of GalNAcIII  and C4 of GlcA at δ 79.2 and 81.5, as compared with those in non-substituted β-Galp NAc and β-Glcp A [16] , resulted from the substitution at O3 and O4, respectively. Taking into account the NOESY data, one could conclude that GlcA is attached to GalNAcIII  at position 3. Of the signals for C3 and C4 of GalNAcII , only that for C3 was shifted, as expected, downfield to δ 77.3, whereas the signal for C4 remained almost at the same position at δ 69.0 as in non-substituted β-Galp NAc [16] . This could be accounted for by strong deviation from the expected regular conformation of the 1→4-glycosidic linkage in a sterically hindered trisaccharide fragment of three GalNAc residues with vicinal substitution at positions 3 and 4 of GalNAcII  (compare also published data [18] ). On the basis of the data obtained, it was concluded that the OPS of P. mirabilis  O29 has the following structure:    As the OPS of P. mirabilis  O24 studied in this work and most other Proteus  OPSs with known structure [5] , the OPS of P. mirabilis  O29 is enriched in N -acetylamino sugars. Also typical of Proteus  OPSs, this is an acidic polysaccharide containing D -glucuronic acid, a component of OPSs of many other Proteus  serogroups [5] . Although different in sugar composition, the main chains of the OPSs of P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 exhibit some degree of structural similarity.  3.3 Serological studies Sera of 75 healthy volunteers and 56 hospitalised patients were tested in ELISA for the presence of IgG class antibodies against LPSs of P. mirabilis . 48.0% and 49.3% sera of volunteers contain anti-P. mirabilis  O24 and anti-P. mirabilis  O29 antibodies, respectively. The level of patients’ sera reacting with P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 LPSs was significantly higher (80.4% and 67.9%, respectively). These data indicated a role of P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 as pathological agents in humans. P. mirabilis  O24 LPS reacted with rabbit anti-P. mirabilis  O24 serum at high titres of 1:102 400 in passive hemolysis (PH) and 1:128 000 in ELISA. Alkali-treated LPS demonstrated the same reactivity in ELISA as LPS, whereas P. mirabilis  O24 OPS was less active (titre 1:16 000). A weaker reactivity of the OPS could be accounted for by the importance of the core-lipid A moiety of LPS in the exposure of the OPS chain optimal for antibodies binding or by the specificity of a significant fraction of antibodies to the LPS core (see below). A Smith-degraded LPS and a core oligosaccharide, obtained by mild acid degradation of the LPS, were inactive. The intact LPS and alkali-treated LPS at doses of 4.9 and 78 ng, respectively, inhibited the reaction in ELISA and PH in the homologous system of anti-P. mirabilis  O24 serum/P. mirabilis  O24 LPS. The OPS inhibited the reaction only in ELISA at as high dose as 625 ng, whereas the Smith-degraded LPS and the core oligosaccharide were inactive. Therefore, the lateral Gal residue, which is destroyed by Smith degradation, is crucial for manifesting of the O24 specificity. LPSs from various Proteus  strains representing more than 30 O-serogroups were tested in ELISA with rabbit anti-P. mirabilis  O24 antiserum. A strong cross-reactivity was observed between anti-P. mirabilis  O24 serum and P. mirabilis  O29 LPS (titres 1:32 000 and 1:4000 with late and early sera, respectively). Vice versa, from rabbit anti-O sera against over 30 Proteus  strains tested, only that to P. mirabilis  O29 cross-reacted in ELISA with P. mirabilis  O24 LPS to a high dilution of 1:16 000. The close serological relatedness of P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 LPSs was confirmed by PH data (Table 2 ). Preincubation of anti-P. mirabilis  O24 serum with the homologous LPS abolished the reactivity in PH with both P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 LPSs. Preincubation of the same serum with the heterologous P. mirabilis  O29 LPS reduced slightly the reactivity with P. mirabilis  O24 LPS and abolished the reactivity with P. mirabilis  O29 LPS. Absorption of anti-P. mirabilis  O29 serum by the LPS of P. mirabilis  O29 or O24 reduced significantly the reactivity with both antigens. Therefore the strong two-way cross-reactivity of P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 is due to the presence of a common epitope(s) on the LPSs. A cross-reactivity of Proteus  strains belonging to different O-serogroups is not uncommon [5] . Most often cross-reactive antibodies recognise identical or similar oligosaccharide fragments on the OPS, from a disaccharide to a tetrasaccharide. The main chains of the OPSs of P. mirabilis  O24 and O29 are structurally similar and, thus, might share a cross-reactive epitope(s). However, in Western immunoblotting, a ladder-like banding typical of LPSs with variable chain length OPSs was observed only with homologous anti-P. mirabilis  O24 and anti-P. mirabilis  O29 sera (Fig. 2A, B , respectively). The reaction of both anti-O sera with the heterologous LPSs of P. mirabilis  O29 and O24 was limited to fast-migrating bands, which correspond to the core-lipid A moiety (Fig. 2 , lanes 1 and 3). The corresponding heterologous whole cells did not react (Fig. 2 , lanes 2 and 4) and, therefore, cross-reactive epitopes are not exposed on the cell surface. These findings suggested that antibodies against the core-lipid A region of the LPS, rather than those against the OPS, are responsible for the cross-reactivity observed. A high level of anti-core-lipid A antibodies may be due to the exposure of OPS-lacking LPS species on the surface of P. mirabilis  O24 and O29. A low degree of substitution of the core by the OPS has been demonstrated for P. mirabilis  S1959 LPS (serogroup O3) [19] . A cross-reactivity has been reported for some other Proteus  strains with structurally different OPSs and likewise accounted for by the presence of antibodies recognising the core region of LPS [20,21] . It can be suggested that the LPS core regions in the cross-reactive strains are similar or identical, but their exact structures remain to be determined.
