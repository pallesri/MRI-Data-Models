    Emotional or social stress is consistently viewed as an important factor in voluntary ethanol  consumption. Isolation stress was shown to be one of the factors determining the inclination to  voluntary ethanol intake. Furthermore, the level of alcohol motivation directly correlated with the  degree of stress (1). Early maternal deprivation may predispose animals to increased ethanol  consumption as adults (2). Also, adult isolated rats drank significantly more alcohol than control  rats (3). Social isolation and loneliness may contribute to ethanol consumption in aged humans.  Late-onset drinking, defined as onset of the first alcohol problem at or after age 60, is believed  to be related to life and social stress of aging particularly when coping with resources or social  supports are inadequate (4-5) and was not uncommon (6).    A long-debated "tension reduction" hypothesis postulates anti-anxiety effects to be important for  ethanol reward, and states that elevated anxiety levels might predispose to ethanol consumption  and addiction (7). Exposure to stress can increase ethanol consumption and ethanol can  attenuate the behavioural and biochemical effects of stress (8). Furthermore, there is a  relationship between voluntary ethanol intake and escape from the consequences of stress (9-  10). In rats, previous reports (7) support a relation between experimental anxiety and voluntary  alcohol consumption.    Since previous reports showed that alprazolam, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, partially  reversed many effects of stress in rodents (11-15), we then postulated that this drug should  affect    Corresponding Author: Maria J.

Therefore, in the present  report we study the effect of alprazolam on the voluntary alcohol consumption in Sprague-  Dawley aged rats exposed to isolation stress.    Methods    Rats    Aged (18 months) female rats (240 10 g) of the Sprague-Dawley strain (Interfauna Ibica  S.A., Barcelona, Spain) were used. They were housed, 7 days before experiments, five per  cage in a temperature (22-24C) and humidity controlled animal room, with an alternating 12-hr  light-dark cycle (lights on at 0600, lights off at 1800), with food (Ultrasorb, PANLAB, Barcelona,  Spain) and drink ad libitum.    Procedure    Twenty five rats were randomly assigned, five per group, in the following groups according to the  treatment they were submitted to: GROUP A. unstimulated controls, GROUP B. unstimulated  rats injected with placebo, GROUP C. unstimulated rats injected with alprazolam, GROUP D.  stressed rats injected with placebo, GROUP E. stressed rats injected with alprazolam.    Drinking solutions    Two drinking solutions were used. One consisted of a 0.2% saccharin solution and the other  consisted of the same solution containing 10% (v/v) ethanol. The solutions were prepared on  alternate days and stored in air-tight containers until used.    Induction of stress    Isolation stress (ISOL) was conducted by placing the animals alone in a novel environment  alone. Stress periods ranged from 1 to 4 hours on a random unpredictable schedule distributed  throughout during the day. The total amount of exposure to ISOL was of 12 hours. Unstimulated  rats were exposed only to the normal activity of the animal room. Groups D and E were  submitted to the same ISOL exposure. Following a 10 day baseline period, the animals were  given 4 day of ISOL on an unpredictable schedule, followed by 4 day recovery period (16).  Cages (Cage FI, Iffa-Credo, Griffa SA, Barcelona, Spain) of 305 mm depth x 180 mm width x  184 mm height internal dimensions were used both for control housing conditions and ISOL.  They were always placed in the same animal room.    Quantification of alcohol consumption    During days 1-7, the saccharin solution was presented in both tubes. Following this, saccharin  was presented in one tube and ethanol-saccharin in the other tube for the duration of the study.  The volumes remaining in each tube were recorded daily during the period 11.00-13.00 hours,  the tubes were refilled and their positions (left-right) alternated to prevent the development of  positional preference (16). Daily fluid consumption (both ethanol and saccharin) and body weight  were monitored and daily ethanol intake in g/Kg per day were calculated (17). Low, medium and  high ethanol consumption were defined by the means of daily ethanol consumption (1.5-2.5; 2.5-  4.5; 4.5-6.0 g/Kg/day, respectively) (18).    Drug treatments    Alprazolam was intraperitoneally injected at 1 mg/Kg, in a volume of 1 ml/kg of 1% aqueous  solution of carboxymethylcellulose as vehicle. The same volume of diluent was used as placebo.  Drugs were daily administerd at 09.30 a.m.    Statistical analysis    Mean 24 hour fluid consumption for each group of animals was computed in g/Kg body weight  SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA with grouping of means by Student  Newman-Keuls multiple range tests with significance set at p < 0.05 (16).    Vol. 64, No. 20, 1999 Alprazolam, Ethanol Consumption and Stress PL-215    Results    Table 1 summarizes the data from the study. Isolation stress significantly increased the ethanol  consumption of the Sprague-Dawley aged rats. Stress induced high ethanol consumption  compared to those of the control and unstressed group rats, which exhibited a medium ethanol  intake. Also, at the post-stress period stressed animals exhibited a significantly greater ethanol  consumption than control and non-stressed groups. Treatment with alprazolam (1 mg/Kg)  partially reversed that adverse effect of stress. Treatment with drugs did not affect the free-  choice ethanol consumption in unstressed rats. Saccharin consumption was not influenced by  ISOL stress. Total fluid consumption was significantly increased in stressed rats, because of the  significant increase in ethanol consumption in stressed rats as compared to control and  unstressed groups (Table II).

(S: Saccharine; T: Total)    PL-216 Alprazolam, Ethanol Consumption and Stress Vol. 64, No. 20, 1999    Discussion    The presented data shows that isolation stress powerfully increased the voluntary ethanol  consumption in aged rats. Our data is in good agreement with those previously reported in  young and adult rats (2, 3, 7, 19).    Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. At least one of the  neuroendocrine responses to stress, i.e. the adrenal corticosterone hypersrion via ACTH  secretion, has been shown to modulate stress increased ethanol consumption (20-22). Firstly,  adrenalectomized rats showed neither evidence of enhancement (21) nor did decrease their  ethanol intake compared to the sham-operated controls (22), and the treatment with  corticosterone restored the intake of ethanol to the preoperative level (22). In contrast, treatment  with aldosterone had no effect on ethanol intake (22). Secondly, treatment of stressed rats with  the enzyme inhibitor cyanoketone, which blocks stress-induced but not basal corticosterone  secretion, at least partially prevented the stress-induced increase in ethanol drinking (21). Also,  exposure to repetitive unpredictable stressful stimuli did not induce the free-choice post-stress  consumption of ethanol either in hypophysectomized rats or chronic dexamentasone treated rats  (20).    Aged rats exposed to unpredictable stressful stimuli increased their ethanol intake during the  stress period and maintained this increase throughout the entire post-stress period as compared  to non-stressed animals. There is an age-related deficiency in HPA response to stress as well as  decline in negative feed-back sensitivity to glucocorticoids (23). On the other hand, ethanol  stimulates corticosterone secretion in rats (24). But, whereas young rats exhibit complete  tolerance to the stimulatory effects of ethanol on corticosterone levels, impaired adaptation of  the hypotalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to ethanol in aged rats was reported (24). Thus, the loss in  the ability to down-regulate both, stress and ethanol responses, and the elevated glucocorticoids  might induce increased ethanol consumption during post-stress period noted in our study.    Alprazolam partially reversed the adverse effect of stress on the free-choice alcohol  consumption. It has been reported that anxiolytics reduced the response of CRF, ACTH and  corticosterone to stress (11, 25-26); so this might be one of the reasons to reverse the increase  in alcohol consumption induced by stress This is a benzodiazepine agonist with well-known  anxiolytic properties which was found to reduce the stress-induced decrease in the immune  function (12-14), which was associated with a proportional suppression of the stress-induce a  increase in plasma ACTH levels (27) which were attributed to activation of GABA-linked BZD  receptors in the CNS. Central pharmacological effects related to the central type benzodiazepine  (BZD) acting by facilitating inhibitory GABA neurotransmission in CNS may regulate the release  of neuroendocrine hormones involved in the response to stress.    In summary, the present results suggest that exposure to unpredictable isolation stress  produces enhancement of ethanol consumption at the stress and post-stress periods, which are  partially reversed by alprazolam.
