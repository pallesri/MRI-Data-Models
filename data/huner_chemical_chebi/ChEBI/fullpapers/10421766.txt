  Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are responsible for  producing a large number of 12, 14- and 16-membered  macrolide antibiotics including methymycin, erythromycin  and tylosin. These large, multifunctional enzymes  (>300,000 kDa) catalyze the biosynthesis of polyketide  macrolactones through multistep pathways involving  decarboxylative condensations between acyl thioesters fol-  lowed by cycles of varying B-carbon processing [l]. The  ability to control aspects of polyketide biosynthesis, such  as monomer selection, degree of B-carbon processing and  stereoselectivity, by genetic manipulation of PKSs has  stimulated great interest in the combinatorial engineering  of novel antibiotics [2,3]. Picromycin (1; Figure 1) is of par-  ticular interest for such use because of its close structural  relationship to ketolide compounds (e.g. HMR 3004), a  new class of semisynthetic macrolides with activity against  pathogens resistant to erythromycin [4]. Genetic systems  that allow rapid engineering of the picromycin PKS would  therefore be valuable for creating novel ketolide analogs  for pharmaceutical applications.  A pivotal development for modular PKS engineering was  the heterologous expression of the erythromycin PKS  (6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase, DEBS) in Streptomyces  coelicolor [5,6]. The advantages to this plasmid-based  genetic system for DEBS were that it overcame the  tedious and limited techniques for manipulating the  natural DEBS host organism, Saccharopolyspora etythaea, it  allowed more facile construction of mutant PKSs, and it  reduced the complexity of PKS property analysis by pro-  viding a leanhost background. This system also expe-  dited the construction of the first combinatorial modular  polyketide library in Streptomyces [7]. Despite the success  of this system, as well as the increased number of modular  PKS gene clusters currently available, DEBS remained  the only modular PKS reported to be expressed in a het-  erologous organism.  The picromycin gene cluster from Streptomyces venezuelae  was recently cloned and sequenced by Sherman and  coworkers [8] and in our own laboratories ([9]; M.C.B.,  unpublished observations). S. venezuelae is unique among  macrolide-producing organisms because it produces  primary polyketides with two different ring sizes. In addi-  tion to the 14-membered macrolide picromycin (l), the  12-membered macrolide methymycin (2; Figure 1) is also  produced. Based on the structural similarities between                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             CHBIOL 80087 S1074-5521(99)80087-8 10.1016/S1074-5521(99)80087-8   Elucidating the mechanism of chain termination switching in the picromycin/methymycin polyketide synthase Li Tang  Hong Fu  Melanie C Betlach  Robert McDaniel *  mcdaniel@kosan.com  KOSAN Biosciences, Inc., 3832 Bay Center Place, Hayward, CA 94545, USA  * Correspondence: Robert McDaniel.      Background A single modular polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster is responsible for production of both the 14-membered macrolide antibiotic picromycin and the 12-membered macrolide antibiotic methymycin in Streptomyces Venezuelas . Building on the success of the heterologous expression system engineered using the erythromycin PKS, we have constructed an analogous system for the picromycin/methymycin PKS. Through heterologous expression and construction of a hybrid PKS, we have examined the contributions that the PKS, its internal thioesterase domain (pikTE) and the Pik TEII thioesterase domain make in termination and cyclization of the two polyketide intermediates.  Results The picromycin/methymycin PKS genes were functionally expressed in the heterologous host Streptomyces lividans , resulting in production of both narbonolide and 10-deoxymethynolide (the precursors of picromycin and methymycin, respectively). Co-expression with the Pik TEII thioesterase led to increased production levels, but did not change the ratio of the two compounds produced, leaving the function of this protein largely unknown. Fusion of the PKS thioesterase domain (pikTE) to 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) resulted in formation of only 14-membered macrolactones.  Conclusions These experiments demonstrate that the PKS alone is capable of catalyzing the synthesis of both 14- and 12-membered macrolactones and favor a model by which different macrolactone rings result from a combination of the arrangement between the module 5 and module 6 subunits in the picromycin PKS complex and the selectivity of the pikTE domain.
