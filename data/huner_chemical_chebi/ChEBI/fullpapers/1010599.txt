INTRODUCTION    We have recently shown that rabbit antibodies to the p-azophenylphosphorylcholine (APPC) determinant, which bears 2 charges of opposite sign, have both positively and negatively charged groups in their binding sites (Krausz et al., 1976). The positive charge is contributed by the guanidinium group of arginine and the negative charge is contributed by the carboxylate group of either a glutamyl or aspartyl residue. We have also previously shown (Grossberg et al., 1974) that the phosphorylcholine-binding mouse myeloma protein, HOPC-8, similarly contains gaunidinium and carboxylate groups in its binding site.   In an attempt to gain further insight into the nature of these binding sites we have measured the relative binding constants of several structurally related small molecules with anti-APPC antibodies and with HOPC-8. The Krel values for hapten binding to the rabbit anti-APPC antibodies and to the myeloma protein, together with our evidence for specific functional groups in the binding sites, have allowed us to draw inferences regarding the topography of the binding sites of anti-APPC antibodies and HOPC-8.     * This work was supported in part by U.S. Public Health Service Research Grants CA-11656 and AI-03962 from the National Cancer Institute.   t A unit of the New York State Department of Health.   $ Abbreviations used: APPC, p-azophenylphosphorylcholine; NPPC, p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine; PC, phosphorylcholine; GPC, L-a-glycerophosphorylcholine; AcC, acetylcholine; I-Ap, p-iodophenyltrimethylammonium; PO3, phenylphosphate; 03 , phenylphosphonate; BBS, borate buffered saline.    901    MATERIALS AND METHODS    p-Diazonium phenylphosphorylcholine chloride (DPPC)     This was prepared according to Chesebro & Metzger (1972) with the exception that in the diazotization step 1.0 N HCl rather than 0.1 N HCl was used (Grossberg et al., 1974).    Haptens     Haptens tested were reagent grade commercial products, used without further purification.    Goat anti-rabbit IgG     This serum was a preparation previously described (Hoffman et al., 1971).    Rabbit anti-mouse IgA     This serum was obtained from Dr. Oliver A. Roholt of our Department. It was prepared by hyperimmunization of rabbits with MOPC-315 myeloma protein.    Anti-APPC antibodies     The preparation of rabbit antisera to the APPC determinant and the subsequent isolation and purification of the antibodies from individual rabbits by specific immunoadsorption has been described previously (Krausz et al., 1976). In the present work preparations from rabbits 6055 and 6057 were specifically purified anti-APPC antibodies and the preparation from rabbit 5920 was a gamma globulin fraction of anti-APPC serum.    HOPC-8 myeloma protein     This was obtained from the serum of tumor-bearing mice as previously described (Grossberg et al., 1974). The myeloma tumor was obtained through the courtesy of Dr. Michael Potter, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.  L. M. KRAUSZ, A. L. GROSSBERG and D. PRESSMAN    Rabbit serum albumin (RSA)     This was Fraction V obtained from Pentex, Inc., Kankakee, IL.    RSA-APPC     This was prepared by reacting 160 mg of RSA in about 10 ml of pH 9.5 borate buffer with 90 umoles of DPPC for 18 hr. The solution was then dialyzed against pH 8 z BBS, stored frozen and used as needed. The entire prep- ae aration was carried out at 4.    Radioiodination of RSA-APPC     RSA-APPC was trace labeled with '251 by a modification of the method of Greenwood et al. (1963). Iodination was carried out in 0.45 ml of pH 8 BBS containing 200 Ug (ca. 3 n-mole) RSA-APPC, 1 n-mole of KI, 0.4 mCi of 'ZSI and 300 n-mole of chloromine T. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min, stopped with 300 n-mole of bisulfite and the product dialyzed to remove free "'I and reagents.    Measurement of K,e,     The method used to obtain the relative binding constants for the various haptens is based on the technique originally developed by Skom & Talmadge (1958) for precipitating antigen-antibody complexes with antiglobulin. In our assay the primary haptenic determinant, p-azophenylphosphory1choline, was coupled to rabbit serum albumin which was then trace labeled with 1251. Labeled antigen was mixed with varying amounts of antibody and the amount of antigen bound was determined by precipitating all the gamma globulin (i.e. bound and unbound antibody as well as non-specific y globulin) with goat antiglobulin antibody and measuring the radioactivity associated with the precipitate. Relative binding constants (K,e,) for the different haptens were determined by measuring their ability to inhibit the reaction of labeled antigen with antibody. The amount of antibody was chosen so that about 60% of the labeled antigen was bound by antibody in the absence of hapten. In a typical determination the antigen solution was made to contain 100 ng per ml of 1251-RSA-APPC and 1 mg/ml of RSA in pH 8 BBS. The required concentration of antibody was made up in normal rabbit serum diluted 1:5 with pH 8 BBS. HOPC-8 myeloma protein was made up in normal mouse serum diluted 1:5. To 0.1 ml of antibody (or HOPC-8) solution were added, 0.1 ml '251-RSA-APPC solution and 0.1 ml hapten solution in pH 8 BBS. Hapten concentrations ranged from 10' to 10-'M. In one sample (uninhibited), hapten solution was replaced by buffer to determine the amount of antigen precipitated in the absence of hapten. Another mixture (non-specific control) contained 0.1 ml 1:5 diluted normal rabbit (or mouse) serum in place of antibody, 0.1 ml of antigen and 0.1 ml of buffer. All tubes were incubated at 37 for 30 min. Then 0.2 ml of anti-globulin antiserum was added to all tubes. The amount added was that determined to be sufficient to precipitate all the globulin in the mixture. Goat anti-rabbit y-globulin was used to precipitate the rabbit antibodies and rabbit anti-mouse IgA was used to precipitate the HOPC-8 myeloma protein. The reaction mixtures were allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hr, and then stored at 5 overnight. The tubes were centrifuged, the supernatants discarded and the precipitates washed twice with saline. Radioactivity in the precipitates was determined. All determinations were done in duplicate.

A representative list of some of these non-inhibitory haptens is given in Table 2.   The results of inhibition studies with the mouse myeloma protein HOPC-8 are given in Fig. 3 where the inhibition curves are drawn only for those haptens showing significant ability to inhibit. K,e, values were calculated as described above and are listed in Table 3. For comparison, Table 3 also lists values of K,el calculated from the data of Leon & Young (1971) for TEPC-15 in a system using the C-polysaccharide of pneumococcus as an antigen. There is adequate serological and chemical evidence showing that HOPC-8 and TEPC-15 are nearly identical proteins (Potter & Lieberman, 1970; Hood et al., 1970). The values in Table 3 show the close correspondence between our values of K,e, for HOPC-8 and those calculated from the data of Leon & Young for TECP-15.   The K,e, values for anti-APPC from rabbit 6055 are also listed in Table 3 to facilitate comparisons with HOPC-8.   In order to assess further the validity of the inhibition method as used here for obtaining Kre, values, we have compared the value of K,e, calculated from the individual binding constants of HOPC-8 for phosphory1choline (PC) and p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (NPPC) as determined by equilibrium dialysis, to the Kre, values calculated from the inhibition data. As measured by equilibrium dialysis with HOPC-8 the binding constant for PC (KPc) was found to be 1.2 x 106 M-1 and for NPPC the KNPPC was 0.43 x 106 M-1 (Krausz et al., 1976). The ratio of the two is:    1.20 x 106 _  KPCIKNPPC - 0.43 x 106 - 2.8.    Table 2.

The ratio obtained using K,e, values obtained by hapten inhibition (Table 3) is 2.9, a satisfactory agreement.    DISCUSSION     The relative binding constants (K,,,) for haptens to anti-APPC antibodies were determined by hapten inhibition. About 30 potential ligands were tested and only 5 of these were shown to bind significantly (NPPC, glycerophosphorylcholine, I-Ap, choline and phosphorylcholine). The values of K,,, obtained with the several haptens allow inferences as to the relative importance of the particular structural features of each hapten in contributing to the binding energy.   The rabbit anti-APPC antibodies studied here were raised against a hapten having 3 distinct structural features-a p-azophenyl group, a negatively charged phosphoryl ester group, and a positively charged quarternary ammonium group. Of these, the one apparently very important for binding is the positively charged group, since haptens which were most effective in inhibiting the binding of the APPC-containing antigen to antibody contained this group (Table 1) and those least effective did not. Thus, removal of the choline group from phenylphosphorylcholine decreases its binding strength by a factor of about    Table 3.

PRESSMAN    10,000 since K,e, for phenylphosphate was at least this much smaller than the K,e, for NPPC (Table 1). Moreover, p-iodophenyltrimethylammonium gave detectable inhibition with one anti-APPC preparation, although its structure is otherwise rather different from the choline inhibitors.   The p-nitrophenyl group of NPPC contributes very effectively to the specific interaction, since replacing it by the glycerol group decreases the binding by a factor of 50 (Table 1). Similarly, removing the p-nitrophenyl group, to give phosphorylcholine, decreases the binding by another factor of 50 (Table 1) so that phosphorylcholine binds 2500 times more weakly than NPPC.   The negatively charged phosphoryl group apparently interacts only to a small extent with the antibody site. This is evident from the fact that K,,, for phosphorylcholine is only 6-8 times greater than Kre, for choline for 2 antibody preparations studied and is actually smaller than that for choline for the third antibody preparation (Table 1). In addition, phenylphosphate (Table 2) and phenylphosphonate (Table 1) show only weak binding to the antibodies. Thus the contribution of the negative charge to binding is not great, in spite of the fact that we have previously shown (Krausz et al., 1976) that a positively charged arginyl residue is present in the anti-APPC antibody site, providing a basis for electrostatic interaction with the phosphoryl group.   When the rabbit anti-APPC antibodies are compared to the mouse myeloma protein, HOPC-8, some very obvious differences in specificity are apparent. In general HOPC-8 shows broader cross-reactivity than the induced rabbit antibody. The representative comparison of K,e, values (relative to NPPC) given in Table 3, indicates that many more of the compounds listed show appreciable binding (K,e, > 0.005) to HOPC-8 than to rabbit anti-APPC. In addition, the fine specificity of HOPC-8 is quite different from that of the rabbit antibody, since the relative binding constant for phosphorylcholine is 10' greater with HOPC-8 than with rabbit anti-APPC. The binding to the 2 proteins differs for glycerophosphorylcholine by a factor of 25, for chohne by a factor of 100 and for acetylcholine by a factor greater than 100. The negatively charged phosphoryl group appears to be much more important for binding to HOPC-8 than to the rabbit antibody, since the K-, value for phosphorylcholine is greater than that for choline by a factor of about 300 in the case of HOPC-8. For rabbit antibody this factor is only about 10 (Table 3). Moreover, phenylphosphate binds more than 10 times more strongly to HOPC-8 than to anti-APPC antibody. This is in spite of the fact that the addition of the p-nitrophenyl group to phosphorylcholine neither adds to nor subtracts from the binding energy with HOPC-8, whereas it adds a great deal to the binding energy with anti-APPC antibody.   The fact that the HOPC-8 site is large enough to accommodate the p-nitrophenyl group of NPPC with little steric hindrance is of interest, since the site of McPC-603 protein, which also binds phosphorylcholine analogues with similar although not identical specificity (Leon & Young, 1971) also can accommodate a large substituent on phosphorylcholine. Thus, the X-ray crystallographic structure studies of the Fab    fragment of McPC-603 as summarized by Segal et al. (1974) indicate that there is a large region of the cleft in which phosphorylcholine is bound which is available for binding additional structure. Indeed, one of the compounds used in defining the site region was 2-(5'-acetoxy-mercury-2'-thiemyl)-ethylphosphory1choline (Padlan et al., 1973). Our studies suggest that this large compound might bind equally as well to the HOPC-8 site as to the McPC-603 site.   The differences between HOPC-8 sites and rabbit anti-APPC sites are interesting in view of the fact that when APPC conjugated to protein is used as an immunogen in the BALB/c mouse, the IgM antibodies elicited are largely of the HOPC-8-TEPC-15 idiotype and show the same binding characteristics as the myeloma proteins (Lee it al., 1974). Thus it appears that the receptor sites on cells responding to APPC in the rabbits we used are quite different in structure from sites on cells which respond in the mouse. Furthermore, we have previously observed that the rabbit antibodies are rather heterogeneous, as evidenced by their non-linear binding curves (Krausz et al., 1976), and their complex isoelectric focusing patterns (Nutt et al., 1976). Populations of anti-APPC antibodies produced also differ from rabbit to rabbit as evidenced by the differences in binding strength for p-iodophenyltrimethylammonium and for choline shown by antibodies from rabbits 6055 and 5920 (Table 1). On the other hand, the induced mouse antibodies appear to be essentially monoclonal products (Lee et al., 1974).   There are, of course, some similarities between the rabbit antibodies and HOPC-8. The major of these is that for both binding sites the positively charged quarternary ammonium group appears to be the immunodominant group, since those haptens not containing this group are bound very poorly in both cases (Table 3). Thus a negatively charged carboxylate group which would interact with this group, and which we have shown to be present in the combining site of both HOPC-8 and anti-APPC antibodies, is probably the most important common feature of both sites.   The above considerations allow us to make the following inferences about the topography of the antiAPPC and HOPC-8 binding sites:   (1) The anti-APPC site contains a region closely complementary to the phenyl group of APPC, so that an appreciable part ofAhe binding interaction occurs in this region. The HOPC-8 site accommodates the phenyl group with little interaction energy.   (2) An arginyl residue in the HOPC-8 site contributes a positive charge which interacts strongly with the negative charge on the phosphoryl group. In the anti-APPC site, which also contains an arginyl residue, the interaction with the phosphoryl group is much weaker, and therefore the 2 groups are probably farther apart than in the HOPC-8 site.   (3) Both sites interact strongly with the quaternary ammonium group of choline and thus this group probably closely approaches a carboxylate group present in both sites.
