 Eosinophils may play important roles in allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis)' 2 In such diseases, eosinophiis migrate to inflammatory sites and degranulate eytotoxic proteins such as major basic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). The cytotoxic proteins damage tissues and cause physiologic abnormalities in patients with allergic diseases. Therefore, cosinophil degranulation inhibitors may be anti-allergic drugs. Recently, we found that sulochrin (6), a metabolite of fungi, was a specific inhibitor of eosinophil degranulation3 and also inhibited eosinophll activation and chemotaxis.* We report here the effects of ortho- substituent groups on inhibitory activity to eosinophil degranulation. Chemistry Sulochrin (6) was synthesized as shown in scheme 1. Benzoic acid benzyl ester (5) was obtained by the condensation of 2-bromo benzyl alcohol (2) and benzoic acid (4). Anion induced rearrangement of (5) gave 1- benzoyl benzyl alcohol, which was oxidized to benzoyl benzoic acid without isolation.5' 6 Esterification of the benzoyl benzoic acid followed by debenzylatinn afforded sulochrin (6).7 All other sulochrin derivatives except for (9) were obtained through a modified methodology. Compound 9 was prepared as shown in scheme 2. Results and Discussion The derivatives of sulochrin (6) were examined for their inba"oitory activity against eosinophil degranulation as descn'bed previously.3 At first, ester derivatives were synthesized to examine the structure-activity relationship. As shown in Table la, alkyl esters (11-15) retained activity, and in particular, n-butyl and see-butyl esters   0960-894X/99/$ - see front matter 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Next, we examined the importance of methoxy and hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-12 and C-16 positions (Table lb). Compared to sulochrin (6), 19 showed much less activity. Activity of 16 approached that of sulochrin (6) after methylation of hydroxyl group at C-12 position in 19. Furthermore, compound 17 also showed activity. These results indicate that at least one methoxy group at C-2 or (2-12 position is required for activity. Compound 18, in which two methoxy groups at C-12 and (2-16 positions on the ring B were introduced, showed much less activity than 16 or 17. Furthermore, compound 20 also lost activity. These results indicate that at least one free hydroxyl group at ortho-position on the ring B is required for activity, suggesting that hydrogen bond between 16-OH and carbunyl at (2-10 might contn'bute to activity. We have recently shown that substituents at ortho-positions showed effect on the conformation from the analysis of crystal structures of suiochrin derivatives,a The hydrogen bond between 16-OH and earbonyl at C-10 may contribute to the conformation where the ring B and the central carbunyl planes are co-planner and cross at a right angle to the   1948                      1t.

Compounds 10 and 19, which have more hydrophilic substitution at ortho-positions, lost activity. Therefore, hydrophobicity is also important for activity. In conclusion, we found that i ) alkylester at C-6 position is required; ii ) see-butyl ester at C-6 position is optimal for activity; ill ) optimal hydrophobicity of the ortho-substituents may exist; and iv) the conformation of sulochrin may influence to the inlu'bitory activity against eosinophil degranulation.
