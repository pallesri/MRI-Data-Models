 Abscisic acid (ABA) is a sequiterpene plant hormone that modulates seed development, dormancy, cell division and responses to environmental stresses such as drought, cold, salt, pathogen attack and UV light [1–3] . It is ubiquitous in higher plants and acts via multiple pathways, inducing rapid closure of stomatal pores by ion efflux from guard cells and slower changes in gene expression [4] . Molecular genetic studies in the model organisms maize and Arabidopsis  have resulted in the identification of downstream components of ABA and stress signalling, including protein phosphatases and kinases, transcription factors and a subunit of farnesyl transferase [4–10] . Reverse genetic and biochemical approaches have led to the characterization of ABA- and stress-responsive cis -promoter elements and transcription factors, the functional cloning of a syntaxin and demonstration of the involvement of secondary messengers such as cyclic ADP ribose and calcium [4,11–15] . Despite this rapid progress in understanding the molecular details of ABA signalling, little is known of the mechanisms of ABA perception. Indirect evidence suggests the existence of multiple ABA receptors [16,17] , but with the exception of an unconfirmed report in 1984 [18]  no such receptors have yet been described. Although ABA binding proteins [19,20]  and carrier- mediated uptake of ABA have been reported [21,22] , there is no evidence to link these to the physiological effects of ABA. In this report, we describe the innovative uses of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and flow cytometry to demonstrate biochemical and functional interactions of the monoclonal antibody JIM19 with plasma membranes (PMs) and protoplasts derived from rice embryonic suspension cultures. JIM19 is one of a panel of monoclonal antibodies previously generated against pea guard cell protoplasts [23]  that was shown to modulate ABA responses in barley aleurone protoplasts, another target cell for ABA [24] . Our data show that JIM19 binds to glycoproteins (GPs) in rice PMs and that such binding is antagonized by ABA but not by the structurally related, biologically inactive ABA catabolite, phaseic acid (PA). Transient gene expression assays using β-glucuronidase (GUS)/luciferase and novel flow cytometric quantitation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) demonstrate that ABA but not PA induces Em  promoter activity; such ABA-induced promoter activity is antagonized by JIM19. These results support a model of ABA signalling through a PM complex that includes an ABA receptor and JIM19 epitope-presenting GP.  2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Embryonic rice (Oryza sativa ) callus cultures (Radon 6 from the International Rice Research Institute, Los Baños, Phillipines) were obtained from Dr. Tom Hodges, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47909, USA. Cultures were propagated and digested for making protoplasts as previously described [25]  except that 10 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), pH 5.6, was substituted for phosphate in the Krens’ F medium and 2% weight/volume (w/v) cellulase YC, 0.35% (w/v) macerozyme and 0.1% (w/v) pectolyase Y23 were used for overnight digestion (Karlan Research Products, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Phaseic acid was obtained from Dr. Sue Abrams, Institute of Plant Biotechnology, Saskatoon, Canada. (±)Cis , trans -ABA (Sigma) and phaseic acid were quantified by spectrometry [26]  and their purity and relative quantities confirmed by mass spectrometry using a Finnegan (San Jose, CA, USA) GCQ ion trap [27] .  2.2 Immunological studies JIM19 and JIM20 [23]  were obtained as hybridoma supernatants from Ms. Jan Peart, John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK. For functional assays the supernatants were desalted by passing over NAP-10 columns (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech., Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, or dialyzed against PBS to remove sodium azide and low molecular weight impurities. Immunoblotting to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schull, Dassel, Germany) of PM proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was by standard methods [28] . JIM19 hybridoma supernatant was used to probe immunoblots at 1/100 dilution; JIM20 was used at 1/10 dilution. Rabbit anti-rat IgM conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Zymed, South San Francisco, CA, USA) and the chromogenic substrates nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Sigma) were used to visualize JIM-bound antigens. The titer of JIM19 was estimated to be 2-fold higher than JIM20 by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Sodium periodate (25 mM solution in 50 mM NaOAc, pH 4.3) was applied overnight to blotted PM proteins to oxidize GP carbohydrates before immunodetection with JIM antibodies. Flow cytometry of rice protoplasts was performed on a Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, CA, USA) FACS Vantage dual beam instrument equipped with a 200 μm nozzle and Lysis II acquisition and analysis software. The excitation wavelength for flow cytometry was 488 nm. Fluorescence emission detection was with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 530/30 nm filter set. For Aequoria victoria  GFP studies, live cells were analyzed. Cell viability was determined by flow cytometry of an aliquot of live protoplasts treated five min with 0.01% (w/v) fluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). For immunofluorescence studies, protoplasts at a density of 106 /0.5 ml were incubated for 30 min in Krens-HEPES with or without JIM19 or JIM20 hybridoma supernatant (1/10 dilution). After two washes with Krens-HEPES, the protoplasts were incubated for 20 min with goat anti-rat IgG-conjugated FITC (1/20 dilution, Sigma), washed two times with Krens-HEPES and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 for 30 min.  2.3 Plasma membrane preparation by aqueous two phase partitioning PMs were prepared from fresh or frozen callus cultures according to Larsson [29]  with modifications. The tissue was homogenized by sonication in 50 mM Tris, 0.25 M sucrose, 3 mM EDTA (Sigma), 1 mM MgSO4 , 2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.8. PEG-1540 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) was used instead of PEG-3350 as the upper phase. Membrane marker enzyme assays [30]  for the PM (vanadate-sensitive ATPase), endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (antimycin A-resistant and -sensitive cytochrome c reductases, respectively) indicated a PM-enrichment over total membranes of 7- to 20-fold (data not shown). Protein concentations were determined by the dye binding method [28]  (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).  2.4 Surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis The immunoaffinity purification of JIM19 was as follows. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgM (15 mg; Zymed), dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES, pH 6.5, was covalently bound to 0.5 ml Affigel-Gel 10 support (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Active esters were blocked with 1 M ethanolamide, pH 8. The column was equilibrated with PBS and 5 ml JIM19 hybridoma supernatant passed over the column. After washing with 10 bed volumes of PBS, the JIM19 antibody was eluted with 2 ml 100 mM Gly, pH 2.5 and collected in 0.1 volume of 1 M KH2 Pi , pH 8.0. The purified JIM19 was dialyzed against PBS and frozen at −20°C until further use. Approximately 3 ng immunoaffinity-purified JIM19 was immobilized on a CM5 carboxymethylated dextran chip (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) by amine coupling at pH 4.6 in 10 mM NaOAc using the manufacturer’s provided kit. Detection of SPR was with a BIAcore 2000 (Pharmacia). The JIM19 chip was regenerated after PM binding by passing 0.1 N NaOH over the chip for 60 s. The concentration of immunoaffinity-purified JIM19 used in solution competition experiments was estimated to be 1 ng/μl by NanoOrange (Molecular Probes) fluorescent dye binding and detection with a Cytofluor II microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Rabbit anti-GUS antibody was from Molecular Probes.  2.5 Functional studies Transformation of protoplasts was according to [31] , using 25 μg each of pBM207 and pAHC18 and 3×106  protoplasts/transformation, which were split into six paired samples. pBM207 [32]  contains the 650 bp wheat Em  promoter driving uidA  expression (GUS). pAHC18 contains the 2.0 kb maize ubiquitin promoter driving firefly luciferase (LUC; [33] ) and was included as an internal reference for non-ABA-inducible transient transcription. pCR559 contains the Em  promoter driving a modified GFP (sGFP) with preferred codons and the S65T mutation that gives enhanced fluorescence, faster chromophore formation and slower photobleaching [34] . It was made by ligation of the 3.3 kb. Nco I–Eco RI fragment of pBM207 and the 1.0 kb. Nco I–Eco RI fragment of p35SC4PPDK-sGFP(S65T) containing the nos 3′ terminator [34] . Transformed, washed protoplasts were first treated with 1/10, 1/20, 1/40, or 1/80 volumes of JIM antibody and after 15 min, various concentrations of ABA added to give a final volume of 0.5 ml Krens-HEPES and 0.05% ethanol. For enzyme-based reporter assays, after 18 h incubation, protoplasts were lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer plus 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and LUC activity measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a Monolight 2010 bioluminescence luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA, USA). The LUC limit of detection for a linear response of the detector was approximately 7000 relative light units and the sample activities were between 40 000 and 160 000 relative light units/20 μl extract. GUS activities of the samples were determined according to [35] , using 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide (Rose Scientific, Edmonton, Alta., Canada) as substrate dissolved in 50 mM NaPi , pH 7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3.4 mM N -lauryl sarcosine and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Activities ranged between 4 and 140 pmol 4-methylumbelliferone/h/40 μl extract. Data presented are of experiments that were repeated once with similar results.   3 Results 3.1 JIM19 and JIM20 recognize cell surface glycoproteins in rice Flow cytometry is a powerful tool that is relatively unexploited in plant biology. The application of this technique to embryonic rice protoplasts immunodecorated with the JIM19 antibody demonstrated substantial binding to the cell surface, i.e. the PM (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1B  shows the extent of JIM19 binding to a population of rice protoplasts measured as relative fluorescence intensity of FITC-labelled anti-rat IgG secondary antibody. Approximately 70% of the protoplasts are labelled by JIM19, based on a threshold of background fluorescence of control protoplasts labelled with secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1A ). Similar results were obtained with JIM20 (Fig. 1C ), except the intensity of the fluorescence signal was less than half that of JIM19. JIM20 is related to JIM19 [23]  but had no biological activity [24] . Varying the concentration of JIM antibodies over the range of 1/10 to 1/80 dilution did not affect significantly the percentage of cells labelled (data not shown). These data suggest that the affinity of JIM19 for rice PM epitopes is higher than that of JIM20. In order to characterize further the surface antigens recognized by JIM19 and JIM20, SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed on PMs purified by aqueous two phase partitioning. The lability of the rice PM JIM epitopes to sodium periodate, which oxidizes carbohydrates was tested, as previous work suggested that JIM19 and JIM20 recognize the carbohydrate moieties of GPs [23] . JIM19 and JIM20 recognized exclusively the carbohydrate moieties of multiple PM GPs, evidenced by loss of all immunoreactive signals after treatment of immunoblots with sodium periodate (Fig. 2 ). Similar treatment of an electroblotted non-GP control (β-glucuronidase) had no effect on immunodetection (data not shown). At least five GPs ranging in relative size from 25 kDa to more than 175 kDa were recognized by JIM19. JIM20 also recognized GPs larger than approximately 100 kDa and of similar size to the proteins recognized by JIM19. However, there are also unique PM proteins in the range of 25–60 kDa which react only with JIM19 (Fig. 2 ). A 10-fold higher concentration of JIM20 than JIM19 did not result in a stronger signal or detection of other epitopes (Fig. 2 ), consistent with the flow cytometry data (Fig. 1 ) indicating that the affinity of JIM19 for PM epitopes is higher than that of JIM20.  3.2 Binding of plasma membranes to JIM19 is specifically antagonized by abscisic acid We used an SPR biosensor [36]  to characterize the binding of PM epitopes to JIM19. SPR technology allows monitoring of specific biomolecular interactions between a ligand (e.g. antibody) and an analyte (e.g. antigen), resulting in a change in refractive index measured as arbitrary resonance output units. A major strength of this technology is the sensitive, quantitative, direct determination of real time binding activity in crude, complex mixtures without labelling of components. Three ng (65 fmol of IgM binding sites, assuming 10 binding sites/IgM) of immunoaffinity-purified JIM19 was covalently bound to a carboxymethyl dextran-coated biosensor chip, giving a baseline SPR signal of 21 600 units (Fig. 3 , stage 1). A non-saturating amount of PMs (5 μg of protein, or 100 pmol of ‘average’ [50 kDa] sized proteins) was then bound to the JIM19 chip over a period of 400 s, after which time the binding reaction approached steady state (Fig. 3 , stage 2). The amount of PM bound to the chip was linearly dependent on the amount injected (correlation coefficient r =0.98, n =7; data not shown), as expected for concentrations of analyte far below the equilibrium dissociation constant for independent ligand sites. The detection limit of the biosensor for PM binding was calculated as three times the standard deviation of the baseline SPR signal between sample injections; the PM binding signal was on average more than six times higher than the detection limit (data not shown). About 400 SPR units of specific PM binding were observed under the standard binding conditions (Table 1 ). The specificity of PM binding to JIM19 was investigated using three solution competition assays for JIM antibody specificity. Binding of PMs to the JIM19 chip could be prevented by pre-incubation of PMs with increasing amounts of JIM19 (Table 1 ). JIM20 also antagonized PM binding to JIM19, suggesting that JIM19 and JIM20 do indeed share specificity for the high molecular weight epitopes observed in Fig. 2 . Non-specific interference with PM binding was low, as measured by pre-incubation of PMs with an unrelated antibody (anti-GUS, Table 1 ). Furthermore, JIM19 did not bind to bovine serum albumin (Table 1 ) or to human neutrophil membrane proteins as detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). Assuming the SPR signal due to binding of PM vesicles (average diameter, 100 nm [29] ) is similar to that of other cellular ligands (Pharmacia BIAtechnology Note #105; Uppsala, Sweden), the observed amount of specific binding corresponds to a maximum of 28 fmol of average-sized 50 kDa proteins [36] , or less than 0.03% of the total PM proteins applied. Because previous work suggested that JIM19 may interact with ABA signalling mechanisms [24] , we tested in a solution competition assay the effect of ABA on binding of PMs to the JIM19 chip. A dose-dependent partial inhibition by ABA of PM binding to JIM19 was observed (Fig. 4 ). Statistical analysis of the ABA treatments showed that taken together, the three highest ABA concentrations (>10 μM) resulted in significantly higher inhibition of JIM19 binding to PMs than the three lowest ABA concentrations (<0.1 μM; P <0.04, one-sided t -test, equal variance). The specificity of this inhibition by ABA was demonstrated by control experiments with phaseic acid (PA), an oxidized catabolite of ABA that is biologically inactive in most, but not all, physiological assays [17] . Equivalent concentrations of PA did not affect PM binding to JIM19 (Fig. 4 ). A statistical analysis of the data set indicates that ABA was significantly more active than PA in antagonizing the binding of PMs to JIM19 (one-tailed paired Student’s t -test, P <0.0008, n =16).  3.3 Functional analysis of JIM19 effects on ABA-inducible gene expression In order to explore the biological relevance of the in vitro JIM19 interaction with PMs, ABA and phaseic acid, we quantified by two independent methods ABA-inducible transient expression of the Em  promoter [25,32]  in rice protoplasts. Fig. 5  shows the results of an enzyme-based reporter gene assay in transiently transformed rice protoplasts. Exogenous ABA activated the Em  promoter in a dose-dependent manner, whereas phaseic acid was not active in triggering Em-GUS  expression (Fig. 5 ). Hill et al. [17]  also found phaseic acid to be inactive in inducing Em  gene expression in cultured barley embryos. Thus, the in vivo specificity and sensitivity for ABA perception leading to Em  gene expression (Fig. 5 ) correlate well with the in vitro specificity for ABA antagonism of PM binding to JIM19 (Fig. 4 ). Because protoplasts are a heterogeneous population with potentially different characteristics that might complicate analysis of signalling pathways, we developed a novel, quantitative, ABA-inducible reporter gene expression system based on GFP and flow cytometry. An ABA dose-GFP intensity response curve for populations of protoplasts transiently expressing GFP driven by the Em  promoter is shown in Fig. 6 . Transformation efficiency was approximately one percent (data not shown). Cell viability of the population was affected negatively by high ABA concentrations (Fig. 6 ). Nonetheless, a typical log-linear relationship between ABA dose and GFP abundance in individual cells was observed (Fig. 6 ). Therefore, flow cytometry allows quantitative analysis of Em : GFP expression on a per cell basis. The concentrations of ABA required for transactivation of the Em  promoter in these assays (Figs. 5 and 6 ) are in the physiological range found in plant tissues [3]  and correlate well with concentrations required for ABA-inhibition of PM binding to JIM19 (Fig. 4 ). In an attempt to correlate further the in vitro and in vivo effects of JIM19 on ABA signalling, the ability of JIM19 to antagonize ABA-inducible transient Em : GUS and Em : GFP expression was measured. Initial experiments demonstrated that JIM19 inhibited ABA effects, but that JIM20 had no activity, as reported previously [24] . Consequently, we used JIM20 as a control to account for any non-specific antibody effects. The inhibition of ABA-inducible Em  promoter activation by co-incubation of protoplasts with JIM19, relative to JIM20 treatment, was low but highly significant (Table 2 ; one-tailed paired Student’s t -test, 0.0003<P <0.001). About 45% inhibition of the ABA-inducible expression of the Em-GUS  reporter gene was achieved by treatment of protoplasts with JIM19 at various low ABA concentrations (Table 2 ). The inhibition was consistently 25% when measured by flow cytometry of GFP (Table 2 ). These results on the interaction of JIM19 with ABA perception leading to Em  promoter activation correlate well with the ABA/PM interaction observed in vitro (Fig. 4 ).   4 Discussion The techniques of SPR and flow cytometry have allowed us to probe the mechanisms of JIM19 bioactivity in rice protoplasts. Our working hypothesis and model, based on results presented here, is that the JIM19 antibody recognizes an epitope in rice PMs that interacts with an ABA receptor. It may be that interaction of JIM19 with a surface GP adjacent to, or interactive with, an ABA receptor, particularly masks an ABA binding site and thereby inhibits ABA responses. We speculate that the binding of ABA to a receptor complex in PMs may induce a conformational change that alters the affinity of an O -linked GP epitope for JIM19. In this context it is interesting to note that a putative O -glucosyl transferase (SPY), when overexpressed in barley aleurone cells, can transactivate the ABA-inducible DHN  promoter [37] . There are at least five different GPs that are bound by JIM19 (Fig. 2 ). Solution competition assays with JIM20 showed a high degree of antagonism of PM binding to JIM19 (Table 2 ), suggesting that JIM19 and JIM20 both recognize the high molecular weight epitopes visualized by immunoblots of PM proteins (Fig. 2 ). Although such a heterogeneous system complicates biochemical analyses by SPR, these results do suggest that JIM19 interacts, possibly indirectly, with ABA signalling mechanisms. The semi-quantitative capability of the SPR biosensor allows an assessment of traditional saturable binding assays applied to the postulated ABA receptor, assuming that the calibration of the SPR signal for protein also holds for vesicles. Assuming the observed ABA-antagonized binding of PMs to JIM19 is due to stoichiometric binding of ABA to an ABA receptor which interacts with one of the GPs, then the observed SPR signal corresponds to 50 pCi 3 H-ABA, or approximately 2 Bq (120 dpm)/μg PM protein. This amount of label is near the limit of detection of binding assays. The SPR PM-JIM19 biosensor assay described here provides a novel and sensitive method for characterization of an activity associated with ABA perception. There are conserved heterodimeric GPs in plants and animals, viz. integrins, that function in cell surface recognition, adhesion and signal transduction [38,39] . The affinities and conformation of integrins are modulated by cations and receptor activation [40] . Consistent with an integrin model of ABA signalling is the agonistic effect of multivalent cations on ABA-regulated gene expression [15,41] . In addition, recent reports have demonstrated the existence in plants of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored arabinogalactan proteins [42] , with exciting implications for signal transduction pathways.
