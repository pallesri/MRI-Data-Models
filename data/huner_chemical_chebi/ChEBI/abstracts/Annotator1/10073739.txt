AIMS: Cysteamine, the only drug available for the treatment of cystinosis in paediatric patients, is available as the hydrochloride, the bitartrate and as sodium phosphocysteamine salts. It has been suggested that cysteamine bitartrate  and phosphocysteamine are better tolerated and may have a better bioavailability  than cysteamine hydrochloride. This has, however, never been demonstrated. METHODS: We compared the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of these three formulations of cysteamine in 18 healthy adult male volunteers in a double-blind, latin-square, three-period, single oral dose cross-over relative bioavailability  study. RESULTS: No statistical difference was found between relative bioavailabilities, AUC (0, infinity) (geometric mean and s.d. in micromol l(-1) h: 169+/-51, 158+/-46, 173+/-49 with cysteamine hydrochloride, phosphocysteamine  and cysteamine bitartrate respectively), Cmax (geometric mean and s.d. in micromol l(-1); 66+/-25.5, 59+/-12, 63+/-20) and tmax (median and range in h: 0.88 (0.25-2), 1.25 (0.25-2), 0.88 (0.25-2)) with each of the three forms of cysteamine tested. Bioequivalence statistics (90% confidence intervals) showed non equivalence of Cmax of cysteamine base as the only non equivalence of pharmacokinetics between the three formulations: 90% CI for Cmax relative ratios  to cysteamine hydrochloride were [75.6-105.81 for phosphocysteamine and [74.2-124.2] for cysteamine bitartrate. The only significant adverse event was vomiting whose frequency was inversely correlated with body weight (Spearman's r=-0.76, P<0.001). The nature of the salt tested did not influence vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: While none of the three forms of cysteamine tested has a clear advantage over the others in terms of pharmacokinetics and tolerance profile, this should now however be addressed in patients treated for cystinosis during repeat administrations.
