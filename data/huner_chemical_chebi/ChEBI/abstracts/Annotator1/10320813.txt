Lactosylceramide synthase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-Gal to glucosylceramide, and thus participates in the biosynthesis of most glycolipids in mammals. We have isolated and sequenced the cDNA clone encoding human lactosylceramide synthase. The deduced amino acid sequence of the  human lactosylceramide synthase showed 94.2% identity with rat lactosylceramide synthase. Northern blotting analysis revealed that lactosylceramide synthase mRNA was expressed in various tissues, with the highest level in brain and adrenal gland.
