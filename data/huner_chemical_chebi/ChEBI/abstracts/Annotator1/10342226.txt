The fatty acid composition of caprine milk fat was studied using capillary gas chromatography. Milk was obtained from five goat herds belonging to different breeders in the Murcia region (Spain) and collected monthly (from November to May). The results showed significant differences among herds mainly in long-chain fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0, and C18:2). There were five branched-chain fatty acids (iso- and anteiso-C15:0, iso- and anteiso-C17:0, and iso-C16:0) with > 0.1% of the total fatty acid methyl esters and another 31 (the most monomethylated) with  < 0.1%, including 4-ethyloctanoate, which is implicated in goat-like flavors. To  study the content of trans unsaturated fatty acids, the fatty acid methyl esters  were previously fractionated by AgNO3-thin layer chromatography. The mean contents of trans-C16:1 and trans-C18:1 were 0.16 and 2.12%, respectively. The distribution profile of trans-C18:1 was also studied.
