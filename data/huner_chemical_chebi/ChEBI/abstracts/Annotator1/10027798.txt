Recently, it was shown that diclofenac was metabolized in rats to reactive benzoquinone imines via cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation. These metabolites also were detected in human hepatocyte cultures in the form of glutathione (GSH)  adducts. This report describes the results of further studies aimed at characterizing the human hepatic P450-mediated bioactivation of diclofenac. The reactive metabolites formed in vitro were trapped by GSH and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Thus, three GSH adducts, namely, 5-hydroxy-4-(glutathion-S-yl)diclofenac (M1), 4'-hydroxy-3'-(glutathion-S-yl)diclofenac (M2), and 5-hydroxy-6-(glutathion-S-yl)diclofenac (M3), were identified in incubations of diclofenac with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and GSH. The formation of the adducts was taken to reflect the intermediacy of the corresponding putative benzoquinone imines. While M2 was the dominant metabolite  over a substrate concentration range of 10-50 microM, M1 and M3 became equally important products at >/=100 microM diclofenac. The formation of M2 was inhibited by sulfaphenazole or an anti-P450 2C9 antibody (5-10% of control values). The formation of M1 and M3 was inhibited by troleandomycin, ketoconazole, or an anti-P450 3A4 antibody (30-50% of control values). In studies in which recombinant P450 isoforms were used, M2 was generated only by P450 2C9-catalyzed  reaction, while M1 and M3 were produced by P450 3A4-catalyzed reaction. Good correlations were established between the extent of formation of M2 and P450 2C9  activities (r = 0.93, n = 10) and between the extent of formation of M1 and M3 and P450 3A4 activities (r = 0.98, n = 10) in human liver microsomal incubations. Taken together, the data suggest that the biotransformation of diclofenac to M2 is P450 2C9-dependent, whereas metabolism of the drug to M1 and M3 involves mainly P450 3A4. Although P450s 2C9 and 3A4 both catalyze the bioactivation of diclofenac, P450 2C9 is capable of producing the benzoquinone imine intermediate  at lower drug concentrations which may be more clinically relevant.
