A comparative study of various procedures for tryptophanyl peptide bond cleavage  by BNPS-skatole [2-(2-nitrophenyl)-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine] was carried out on native and on reduced and alkylated bovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). The reaction yield and the composition of the derived products were studied in acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and ethanol/TFA. For BNPS-skatole removal, extraction by water or ethyl ether was compared with dialysis and gel filtration. The three  expected peptides (1-19, 20-61, 62-162) and incomplete cleaved fragments (1-61, 20-162) were separated and characterized by electrophoresis, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The highest hydrolysis yield (67.4%) occurred with native BLG cleaved in 88% acetic acid at 47 degrees C for 60 min. Subsequent water extraction and gel filtration led to total recovery of the material, but reagent elimination was only quantitative after gel filtration. Cleavage specificity was ensured by mass spectrometry and the amino acid composition of peptides 1-19 and 62-162. The chemical side reactions identified are discussed.
