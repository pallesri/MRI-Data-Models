The purpose of this study was to determine the antimutagenicity of WR-1065 added  after irradiation of cells of cell lines differing in their ability to rejoin radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 at the thymidine kinase locus was demonstrated for L5178Y (LY)-S1 cells that are deficient in repair of DNA DSBs. Less postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 was observed in LY-R16 and LY-SR1 cells, which are relatively efficient in DSB repair. Postirradiation treatment with WR-1065 had only a small stimulatory effect on DSB rejoining. A 3-h incubation of irradiated LY cells with WR-1065 caused slight changes in the distribution of cells in the phases of the cell cycle that differed between LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells. Both LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells were protected against the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of radiation when WR-1065 was present 30 min before and during the irradiation. We conclude that the differential postirradiation effects of WR-1065 in the LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells are not caused by differences in cellular uptake of the radioprotector or in its radical scavenging activity. Possible mechanisms for the postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 are discussed.
