During the course of our screening program for low molecular natural products with their ability to potentiate and/or mimic neurotrophic effect of NGF, a novel fungal metabolite, phenylacetic acid hydrazide derivative NG-061 was isolated from the fermentation broth of Penicillium minioluteum F-4627. NG-061 enhanced and mimicked neurotrophic effect of NGF on neurite outgrowth in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12.
