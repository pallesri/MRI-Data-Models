The study on the metabolism after oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid-24-14C was performed by analysis of radioactivity that had appeared in bile  and feces of male hamsters. The radioactive bile acids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and identified by the isotope dilution method. In the bile of the hamsters with bile fistula, radioactivity was originated from unchanged chenodeoxycholic acid for the most part, and 7-ketolithocholic acid, lithocholic  acid, and beta-muricholic acid for the remainder. In the feces lithocholic acid,  dehydrolithocholic acid, isolithocholic acid, and unchanged form were identified. After the multiple dosing of chenodeoxycholic acid-24-14C for 6 days, beta-muricholic acid was also identified in the feces.
