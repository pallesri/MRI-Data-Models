Dopamine D4-like binding sites are abundant in human cerebral cortex as detected  by [3H]nemonapride. The extremely low density of D4 mRNA in human cerebral cortex is inconsistent with the high amount of D4-like binding sites. To investigate the nature of the D4-like receptors, [3H]nemonapride binding sites in the nonhuman primate cerebral cortex were characterized. Although [3H]nemonapride binding sites were D4-like, displaceable by clozapine but not raclopride, [3H]nemonapride binding was not displaced by selective D4 antagonists but was displaced by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL100907. Using [3H]ketanserin as a 5-HT2A ligand, nemonapride showed high affinity for monkey (Ki = 10.4 nM) and cloned human (Ki = 9.4 nM) 5-HT2A receptors, while its affinity for rat receptors was lower (Ki = 140 nM). The present study demonstrates that cerebral cortical D4-like binding sites labeled by [3H]nemonapride in nonhuman primates consist of a very small portion of D4, but a substantial portion of 5-HT2A receptors. The unexpectedly high affinity of nemonapride for primate 5-HT2A receptor suggests reconsidering previous data from other studies using [3H]nemonapride, particularly those on D4-like receptors.
