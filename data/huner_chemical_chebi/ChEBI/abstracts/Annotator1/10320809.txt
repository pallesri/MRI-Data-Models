Rat liver 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase catalyzes not only the hydrolysis of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, but also the transfer of its acyl chain to a second molecule of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to form phosphatidylcholine (H. Sugimoto, S. Yamashita, J. Biol. Chem. 269 (1994) 6252-6258). Here we report the detailed characterization of the transacylase activity of the enzyme. The enzyme mediated three types of acyl transfer between  donor and acceptor lipids, transferring acyl residues from: (1) the sn-1 to -1(3); (2) sn-1 to -2; and (3) sn-2 to -1 positions. In the sn-1 to -1(3) transfer, the sn-1 acyl residue of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was transferred to the sn-1(3) positions of glycerol and 2-acyl-sn-glycerol, producing 1(3)-acyl-sn-glycerol and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol, respectively. In the  sn-1 to -2 transfer, the sn-1 acyl residue of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine  was transferred to not only the sn-2 positions of 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, but also 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, producing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. 1-Acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-myo-inositol  and 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine were much less effectively transacylated by the enzyme. In the sn-2 to -1 transfer, the sn-2 acyl residue of 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was transferred to the sn-1 position of 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, producing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. Consistently, the enzyme hydrolyzed the sn-2 acyl residue from 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. By the sn-2 to -1 transfer activity, arachidonic acid was transferred from the sn-2 position of donor lipids to the sn-1 position of acceptor lipids, thus producing 1-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine. When 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was used as  the sole substrate, diarachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine was synthesized at a rate  of 0.23 micromol/min/mg protein. Thus, 60-kDa lysophospholipase-transacylase may  play a role in the synthesis of 1-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine needed for important cell functions, such as anandamide synthesis.
