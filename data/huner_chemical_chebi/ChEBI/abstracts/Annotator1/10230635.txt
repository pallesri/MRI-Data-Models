The synthesis and the antimicrobial properties of a new series of cephalosporinic beta-lactam antibiotics is described. The data reported in the present paper show the potential of this type of substituted cephalosporins as new anti Gram-positive antibiotic drugs. In fact, all compounds tested showed a good in vitro antibacterial activity against the most relevant Gram-positive pathogens including resistant species that currently represent unmet medical need. On the contrary, the new synthesized compounds were found to be completely devoid of any activity on Gram-negative bacteria up to a concentration of the single agent of 128 microg/ml.
