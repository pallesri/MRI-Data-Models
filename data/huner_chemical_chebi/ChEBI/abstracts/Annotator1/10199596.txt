1. The urinary metabolic fate of 4-fluoroaniline (4-FA) and 1-[13C]-4-fluoroacetanilide (4-FAA) has been studied using NMR-based methods after 50 and 100 mg kg(-1) i.p. doses respectively to the male Sprague-Dawley rat. 2. 4-FA was both ortho- and para-hydroxylated. The major metabolite produced by ortho-hydroxylation was 2-amino-5-fluorophenylsulphate accounting for approximately 30% of the dose. Of the dose, approximately 10% was excreted via para-hydroxylation and the resulting defluorinated metabolites were N-acetylated  and excreted as sulphate (major), glucuronide (minor) and N-acetyl-cysteinyl (minor) conjugates of 4-acetamidophenol (paracetamol). 3. The major route of metabolism of 1-[13C]-4-FAA was N-deacetylation and the metabolites excreted in the urine were qualitatively identical to 4-FA. The paracetamol metabolites produced via para-hydroxylation were also a product of N-deacetylation and reacetylation, as the [13C]-label was not retained. 4. These studies demonstrate  the value of [13C]-labelling in understanding the contribution of N-acetylation,  and futile deacetylation-reacetylation reactions, in aniline metabolism. In addition, this work sheds new light on the metabolic lability of certain aromatic fluorine substituents.
