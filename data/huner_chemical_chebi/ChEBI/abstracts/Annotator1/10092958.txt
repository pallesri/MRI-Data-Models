Meloxicam [4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2H-1,2-benzothiazine -3-carboxamide-1, 1-dioxide] is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of  the oxicam class which shows preferential inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2. Meloxicam has a plasma half-life of approximately 20 hours, making it convenient  for once-daily administration. Meloxicam is eliminated after biotransformation to 4 pharmacologically inactive metabolites, which are excreted in urine and faeces. Meloxicam and its metabolites bind extensively to plasma albumin. Substantial concentrations of meloxicam are attained in synovial fluid, the proposed site of  action in chronic inflammatory arthropathies. Neither moderate renal nor hepatic  insufficiency significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam. Dosage adjustment is not required in the elderly. Drug-drug interaction studies are available for some commonly co-prescribed medications. Concentration-dependent therapeutic and toxicological effects have yet to be extensively elucidated for this NSAID.
