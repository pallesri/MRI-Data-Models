Masoprocol (nordihydroguaiaretic acid) is a lipoxygenase inhibitor isolated from  the creosote bush and used by native healers to treat type 2 diabetes. It has been recently shown to decrease serum glucose, free fatty acid (FFA), and triglyceride (TG) concentrations in rodent models of type 2 diabetes. The current study was initiated to quantify the effects of masoprocol incubation of adipocytes isolated from normal rats. The results indicate that masoprocol significantly increased glucose uptake by adipocytes in both the absence and presence of insulin. In addition, the maximal rate of insulin-stimulated glucose  transport was increased in adipocytes incubated with masoprocol and the insulin concentration resulting in a half-maximal glucose transport rate (ED50) decreased. Finally, isoproterenol-stimulated increases in FFA and glycerol release were significantly decreased in the presence of masoprocol. These results provide an explanation at the cellular level for the observation that masoprocol  decreases serum glucose, insulin, and FFA concentrations in rodent models of type 2 diabetes.
