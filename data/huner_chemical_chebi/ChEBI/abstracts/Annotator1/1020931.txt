LD50 of karminomycin, rubomycin and adriamycin were determined after their single administration or 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-fold administration once a day to 540 hybrid male mice F1(C57B1 X CBA). Comparison of the cumulative indices for these antibiotics showed that after injections they were close. After 5 injections the  cumulative properties were more pronounced for adriamycin. After 10 or 15 injections the cumulative properties were less pronounced for karminomycin.
