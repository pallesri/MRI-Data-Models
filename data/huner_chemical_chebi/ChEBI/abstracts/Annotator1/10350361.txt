Late-onset drinking is a common problem in elderly people related to stress induced by social isolation. Experiments were performed in order to evaluate the  effects of alprazolam, a benzodiazepine agonist anxiolytic, on the free-choice ethanol consumption in aged rats subjected to isolation stress. The animals we offered a two-bottle choice consumption (one of 0.2% saccharin and the other with 10% ethanol/0.2% saccharin) and then exposed to 4 days of isolation stress on an  irregular, unpredictable schedule. Stress resulted in significant increase in ethanol consumption. Treatment with alprazolam (1 mg/Kg) partially reversed this  adverse effect of stress.
