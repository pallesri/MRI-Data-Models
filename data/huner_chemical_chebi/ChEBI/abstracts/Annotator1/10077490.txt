The growth-promoting effects of estrogens in hormone-dependent tumor tissues involve receptor-mediated pathways that are well-recognized; however, the role of estrogens in tumor initiation remains controversial. Estrogen metabolites, primarily the catechol estrogens (CE's), have been implicated in tumor initiation via a redox cycling mechanism. We have developed metabolically stable CE analogues for the study of receptor versus redox cycling effects on DNA damage. Comparisons between hydroxy estradiols (HE2's), methoxy estradiols (ME2's), and hydroxymethyl estradiols (HME2) in potentiometric and DNA damaging studies were made. DNA damage was assessed in calf thymus DNA using 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) as a genotoxic marker for oxidative stress. Increases in the number of 8-oxo-dG/10(5) dG were significant for each 2-HE2 and 4-HE2. Cu(II)SO4, a transition metal known to catalyze the redox cycling of o-quinones, substantially increased the amount of DNA damage caused by both CE's. However, DNA damage was only observed at concentrations of 10 microM or higher, much greater than what is found under physiologic conditions. Furthermore, the presence of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione, SOD, and catalase drastically reduced the amount of DNA damage induced by high concentrations of 2-HE2. There was no DNA damage observed for the non-redox cycling HME2's, making these compounds useful probes in the study of receptor-mediated carcinogenesis. Thus, both 2-HE2 and 4-HE2 are capable of producing oxidative DNA damage at micromolar concentrations  in vitro. However, since the amount of CE's has not been shown to surpass nanomolar levels in vivo, it is unlikely that free radical production via redox cycling of CE's is a causative factor in human tumorigenesis.
