An efficient solid-phase synthesis of benzisothiazolone-1,1-dioxide-based serine  protease inhibitors involving alkylation of carboxylic acids with N-(bromomethyl)benzisothiazolone-1,1-dioxide has been developed. An example using this procedure for preparation of a library of human mast cell tryptase inhibitors is described.
