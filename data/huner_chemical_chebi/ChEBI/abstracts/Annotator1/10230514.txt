Activity-guided fractionation of the roots of Anthriscus sylvestris resulted in the isolation and characterization of five cytotoxic compounds, deoxypodophyllotoxin (1), falcarindiol (2), and angeloyl podophyllotoxin (5) from the hexane soluble fraction and morelensin (3), bursehernin (4) from the chloroform soluble fraction. It is the first report of the occurrence of compound 5 in nature.
