Zonal elution and high-performance affinity chromatography were used to examine interactions of the drugs digitoxin and acetyldigitoxin with the protein human serum albumin (HSA). This was done by injecting small amounts of digitoxin and acetyldigitoxin onto an immobilized HSA column in the presence of mobile phases that contained various concentrations of digitoxin, acetyldigitoxin or other solutes as competing agents. A fixed concentration of beta-cyclodextrin was also  present in the mobile phase as a solubilising agent. It was found that digitoxin  and acetyldigitoxin each had strong interactions at a single common binding site  on HSA, but with slightly different equilibrium constants for this region. Neither compound showed any competition with warfarin or L-tryptophan, which were used as probes for binding at the warfarin-azapropazone and indole-benzodiazepine sites of HSA. These results confirmed the presence of a separate binding region on HSA for digitoxin-related compounds.
