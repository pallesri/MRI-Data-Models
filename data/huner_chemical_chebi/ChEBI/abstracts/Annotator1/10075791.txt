7-Epiclusianone, isolated from Rheedia gardneriana, was tested in several biological assays. It was active in vitro against trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma  cruzi but inactive in vivo in experimentally infected mice. It was also active against Artemia salina, but inactive against the fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum and the snail Biomphalaria glabrata.
