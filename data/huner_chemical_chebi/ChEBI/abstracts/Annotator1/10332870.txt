Localized 1H NMR homonuclear J editing spectroscopy was used to measure the concentration of 2-pyrrolidinone (PRDN) in the human occipital lobe of five normal and six epileptic subjects taking vigabatrin. PRDN is a lactam cyclization product of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). From a localized volume of 13.5 cm3 in the occipital cortex, the concentration of PRDN ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 micromol/g in normal subjects, whereas in epileptic subjects on vigabatrin PRDN was elevated to 0.6 +/- 0.1 micromol/g. The elevated PRDN in patients on vigabatrin was in accord with raised GABA levels compared with normals. 1H NMR measurements of PRDN will be important in assessment of the role of this metabolite for improved seizure control.
