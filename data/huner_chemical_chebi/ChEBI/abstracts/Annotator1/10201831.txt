We compared effects of alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) and its 3alpha- or 3beta-galactosylated derivatives on the proliferation of murine spleen cells. The 3alpha-galactosylated alpha-GalCer showed stronger proliferative response than the parental alpha-GalCer, but the 3beta-galactosylated alpha-GalCer possessed weaker activity than the alpha-GalCer. In addition, alpha-Gal-3-Cer did not show  immunostimulatory activity.
