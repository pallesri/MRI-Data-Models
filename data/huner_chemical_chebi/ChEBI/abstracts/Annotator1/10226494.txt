Ozone-oxygen mixture (ozone concentration 600 microg/l) was used in irrigations of the tympanic cavity in 52 patients with chronic purulent mesotympanitis (CPM). The course of the treatment consisted of 5-7 procedures. 18 CPM controls received standard treatment without the irrigations. The course of the ozone-oxygen irrigations produced good results: ear discharge and tympanic mucosa inflammation stopped in 81% of the irrigated patients, levels of myeloperoxidase which marks inflammation reduced significantly, bactericidal effects of the mixture were observed for all the detected pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity of the bacteria rose. Fast antiinflammatory result of ozone therapy was due not only to its bactericidal effect but also via its antihypoxic and immunomodulating mechanisms.
