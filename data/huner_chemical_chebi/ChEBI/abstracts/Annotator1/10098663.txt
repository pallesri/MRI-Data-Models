A novel series of nonpeptide small-molecular dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors with an N-phenylphthalimide skeleton has been developed. Some of the compounds, including 4-amino-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)phthalimides (7), 4- and 5-hydroxy-(2,6-diethylphenyl)phthalimide (11 and 14), 4-hydroxy-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)phthalimide (12), and thiocarbonyl analogs of (2,6-diisopropylphenyl)phthalimide and their 4,5,6,7-tetrafluorinated derivative  (18, 19 and 20), were more potent than the well-known DPP-IV-specific inhibitor,  Pro-boroPro (PBP). Among them, 18 was revealed to be a DPP-IV-specific inhibitor, while the others also showed inhibitory activity toward another peptidase, aminopeptidase N (APN).
