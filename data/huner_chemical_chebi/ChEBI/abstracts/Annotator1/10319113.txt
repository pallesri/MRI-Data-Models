Three triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the methanol extract of the stem bark of Kalopanax pictum Nakai var. magnificum (Araliaceae). The structures of these saponins were identified as hederagenin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinopyranoside, hederagenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinop yranoside and 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->2)-alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl hederagenin 28-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1-->4)-beta-D- glucopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester.
