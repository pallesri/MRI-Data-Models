Up to now, different methods in guinea pig sensitization were used, to assess contact sensitization potential of low molecular weight chemicals. In order to compare the efficiency of the epicutaneous, intradermal and combined sensitization methods, two stronger sensitizers, the water soluble chlormethylimidazoline hydrochloride (CMI) and the lipid soluble 1,3-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were used for the experiments. Eleven modified sensitization methods were performed. In a first trial each substance was tested  on 10 animals. In a further study those techniques which had produced the best results, that is the highest degree of sensitization, were applied to 25 to 30 animals. For comparison of the results of the various methods, a mean sensitization index was calculated. The best results were achieved with the Maximization Test of Magnusson & Kligman (1969) and the Split Adjuvant Technique  of Maguire & Chase (1967).
