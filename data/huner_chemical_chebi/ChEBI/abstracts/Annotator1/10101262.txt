Recent work within our laboratory has focused on the enzymes we hypothesize are involved in the biosynthesis of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate from phosphatidylglycerol. Here we describe a transacylase, active at acidic pH values, isolated from a macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7. This enzyme acylates the head group glycerol of sn-3:sn-1' lysophosphatidylglycerol to form sn-3:sn-1' bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate. Here we demonstrate that this enzyme uses two lysophosphatidylglycerol molecules, one as an acyl donor and another as  an acyl acceptor, and that the acyl contributions from all other lipids tested are comparatively minor. This enzyme prefers saturated acyl chains to monounsaturates, 16 and 18 carbon fatty acids over 14 carbon fatty acids, and saturated acyl chains at the sn-1 position to monounsaturated acyl chains on the  sn-2 carbon of lysophosphatidylglycerol. We present data which show the transacylase activity depends on the presence of a lipid-water interface and the  lipid polymorphic state.
