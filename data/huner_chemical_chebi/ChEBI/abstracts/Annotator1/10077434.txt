Prolyl endopeptidase (PEP, EC 3.4.21.26) is an enzyme which plays a role in the metabolism of proline-containing neuropeptides, e.g., vasopressin, substance P and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which have been suggested to be involved in learning and memory processes. In our systematic screening for PEP inhibitors  from traditional Chinese medicines, we found that MeOH extract from the underground part of Rhodiola sacra S. H. Fu shows significant inhibitory activity against PEP from Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Examination of the constituents  of the extract resulted in the isolation of nineteen known compounds, identified  as hydroquinone (1), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (2), caffeic acid (3), 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4), suberic acid (5), protocatechuic acid (6), gallic acid (7), (-)-epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (8), 2-phenylethyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (9), 3-O-galloylepigallocatechin-(4beta-->8)-epigallocatechin+ ++ 3-O-gallate (10), 2-phenylethyl alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (11), sacranoside A (12), beta-D-glucopyranosyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (13), rhodiocyanoside A (14), rhodiooctanoside (15), sarmentosin (16), heterodendrin (17), arbutin (18) and 4-O-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-gallic acid (19). Among these, 1, 2, 5, 8-10, 13, 16, 18 and 19 have been isolated for the first time from R. sacra, among which 5, 9, 10, 13, 16, 18 and 19 have been isolated from Rhodiola plants for the first time. On the PEP inhibition, seven compounds (6-8, 10, 12, 18, 19) showed inhibition with an 1C50 of 27.8, 487, 1.47, 0.437, 348, 391 and 215 microM, respectively. The kinetic study of these inhibitors indicated that they are noncompetitive inhibitors, except for 6 which is a competitive inhibitor.
