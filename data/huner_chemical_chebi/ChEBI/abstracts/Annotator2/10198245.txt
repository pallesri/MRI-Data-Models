The purpose of the present study was to investigate the involvement of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and tyrosine kinase on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human gingival fibroblasts stimulated by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and/or epidermal growth factor (EGF). The cytokine IL-1beta and to a lesser extent EGF, enhanced COX-2 mRNA levels in gingival fibroblasts. Simultaneous treatment with EGF and IL-1beta resulted in enhanced COX-2 mRNA levels accompanied by a synergistic stimulation of PGE2 biosynthesis compared to the cells treated with IL-1beta or EGF alone. Neither IL-1beta EGF nor the combination of IL-1beta and EGF enhanced COX-1 mRNA levels in gingival fibroblasts. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Herbimycin A and PD 153035 hydrochloride, reduced COX-2 mRNA levels as well as PGE2 production induced by IL-1beta or the combination of IL-1beta and EGF whereas COX-1 mRNA levels were not affected. Furthermore, the COX-2 specific inhibitor, NS-398, abolished the PGE2 production induced by IL-1beta, EGF, or the combination. These results indicate that the synergy between IL-1beta and EGF on PGE2 production is due to an enhanced gene expression of COX-2 and that tyrosine kinase(s) are involved in  the signal transduction of COX-2 in gingival fibroblasts.
