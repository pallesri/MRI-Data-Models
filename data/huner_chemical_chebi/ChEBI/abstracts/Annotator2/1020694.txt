Dipiperon drops 30-180 mg/day were given for eight weeks to 29 children with character neuroses and behavioural disorders. A 16-item rating-scale covering several features of behaviour disorder was completed by a psychologist and a teacher independent from each other. The individual number of pathological scores showed a decrease already within the first treatment week and a further decrease  by the end of the trial, especially for the items of capriciousness, obstinacy, irritability and restlessness. The therapeutic benefit was not accompanied by an  adverse effect on the school performance of the children. No side-effects were reported or observed.
