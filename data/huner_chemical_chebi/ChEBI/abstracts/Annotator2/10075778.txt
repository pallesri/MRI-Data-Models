Two new jaspamide derivatives (1 and 2) along with jaspamide have been isolated from the marine sponge Jaspis splendans collected in Vanuatu. Their chemical structures were determined from 1D and 2D NMR studies and MS data. These two compounds inhibited the in vitro growth of the NSCLC-N6 human tumor cell lines with IC50 values in the microg/mL range.
