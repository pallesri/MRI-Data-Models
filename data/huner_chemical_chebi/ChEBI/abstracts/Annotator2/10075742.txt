Fractionation of cube resin from Lonchocarpus utilus and L. urucu roots led to the isolation and identification of 11 minor flavonoids and stilbenes containing  the gem-dimethylpyran moiety or a dihydrodiol derivative thereof. The eight new compounds were as follows: the isoflavonoid cis-4'',5''-dihydro-4'',5' '-dihydroxylonchocarpusone (2); four (2S)-6-(gamma, gamma-dimethylallyl)-6'',6''-dimethylpyran[2'',3'':7, 8]flavanones with substituents of 5-hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxy (3), 5, 3'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy (4), 5,4'-dihydroxy-3'-methoxy (5), and 3', 4'-dimethoxy (6); and three 6'',6''-dimethylpyran[2'',3'':3', 4']stilbenes with 4-hydroxy-5'-methoxy (9), 3,5'-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy (10) and 3,4,5-trimethoxy (11) substitution patterns. Structure-activity relationships for inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity (bovine heart electron transport particles) and phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity (cultured MCF-7 cells) generally parallel those  for cytotoxicity (MCF-7 and Hepa 1clc7 cells).
