In this article, a cost-minimization model was used to make an economic comparison between cefmetazole and cefoxitin--two drugs with comparable in vitro  spectra of activity, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles. Drug acquisition costs were estimated from published information and labor and material costs were calculated based on actual costs at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. Costs of the agents were calculated based on the dosage and administration schedules typically used in published clinical trials of cefmetazole and cefoxitin and on the typical dosing patterns of cefoxitin used at Presbyterian Hospital. Results of the cost analysis revealed that an annual savings of $36,015 to $59,143 could be realized  at Presbyterian Hospital if cefmetazole were used in place of cefoxitin for surgical prophylaxis. Furthermore, use of cefmetazole in place of cefoxitin for wound treatment would yield annual savings of $33,242.
