A mixture of oligosaccharides produced by beta-galactosidase using lactose as a substrate was fractionated according to degree of polymerization using gel filtration, followed by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography. The fractions obtained were analyzed using monosaccharide analysis, methylation analysis, mass  spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. Twelve novel non-reducing oligosaccharides were characterized, namely, [beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)]n-alpha-D-Glcp- (1<-->1)-beta-D-Galp[-(4<--1)-beta-D-Galp]m, with n, m = (1, 2, 3, or 4) and beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Glcp- (1<-->1)-beta-D-Galp.
