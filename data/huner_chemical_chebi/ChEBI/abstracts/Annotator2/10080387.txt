A novel phospholipid has been purified from strain Dm 28c of Trypanosoma cruzi, and characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a plasmenylethanolamine with a hexadec-l-enyl group in  the sn-1 position and an approximately equimolar mixture of octadecenoate and octadecadienoate esterified to the sn-2 hydroxyl. The purified plasmenylethanolamine reacted positively when probed with sera from patients with chronic Chagas' disease. Since plasmenylethanolamines of similar structure are abundant in mammalian cardiac and neuronal tissues, cross reactions between these epitopes may be a factor in the mechanism of autoimmune pathology in the chronic  phase of Chagas' disease.
