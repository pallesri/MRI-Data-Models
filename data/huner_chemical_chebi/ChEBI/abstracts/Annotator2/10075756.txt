Three novel triterpene alcohols, camelliols A (1), B (3), and C (5), possessing a mono-, bi-, and tricyclic ring system, respectively, have been isolated, along with achilleol A, a known monocyclic triterpene alcohol, from the nonsaponifiable lipids of sasanqua oil (Camellia sasanqua). The structures of these new alcohols  were determined on the basis of spectroscopic methods.
