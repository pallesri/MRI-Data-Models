Isatin is an endogenous indole and an inhibitor of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptors coupled with particulate guanylyl cyclase (GC). In this study, several isatin analogues were tested as inhibitors of ANP-stimulated GC in rat brain and heart membranes. None of these analogues affected activity in the absence of ANP, or stimulated ANP-induced activity. In both tissues, some 5-substituted isatins (5-hydroxyisatin, 5-methylisatin, and 5-aminoisatin) exhibited more effective inhibitory activity than isatin itself, with IC50 values in the range 1.3-20 microM. The efficacy of other analogues varied and was not consistent between the two tissues, raising the possibility of receptor heterogeneity and relative selectivity of inhibition. Some substituted isatins may have a role as pharmacological tools for investigating the physiological roles of natriuretic peptides and their receptors.
