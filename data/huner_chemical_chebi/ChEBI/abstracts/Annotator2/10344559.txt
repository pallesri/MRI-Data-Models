Phosphatoquinones A and B were isolated from the cultured broth of Streptomyces sp. TA-0363 and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses. Phosphatoquinones A and B inhibited the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity prepared from human Ball-1 cells with IC50 of 28 microM and 2.9 microM, respectively.
