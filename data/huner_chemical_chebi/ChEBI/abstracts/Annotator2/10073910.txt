Tyrosinaemia type I is caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase and mainly affects the liver. This disease is characterized by the presence of a  high level of succinylacetone. This metabolite has been used for prenatal diagnosis from amniotic fluid samples. One case with a normal level of succinylacetone in amniotic fluid has recently been described (Grenier et al., 1996). Here, we report that this patient is a compound heterozygote for two known mutations: E364X and IVS6-1g-->t. The low level of succinylacetone cannot be explained by these mutations.
