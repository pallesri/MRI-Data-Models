The crystal structure of gliclazide, N-[(perhydrocyclopenta [c]pyrrol-2-yl)aminocarbonyl]-p-toluenesulfonamide, C15H21B3O3S, a second-generation oral hypoglycemic agent, contains discrete molecules with normal molecular dimensions. Both of the five-membered fused rings adopt envelope conformations. The molecules are linked into chains by intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving amino-H atoms, with N...O separations of 2.967 (3) and 2.949 (3)  A.
