Three novel sesquiterpene esters of aristolochic acid, aristoloterpenate-II (2),  -III (3), and-IV (4), together with known aristoloterpenate-I (1), were isolated  and characterized from the root and stem of Aristolochia heterophylla. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration of these compounds at C-4' was determined as R by circular dichroic studies. These compounds showed cytotoxicity against hepatoma G2, 2, 2, 15 cells.
