The stable prostacyclin analogue, iloprost relaxes a variety of blood vessels and increases cyclic AMP, although the relationship between adenosine 3': 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and vasorelaxation remains unclear. We therefore investigated the effect of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, 9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (SQ22536) on iloprost-mediated relaxation and cyclic AMP elevation in endothelium-denuded aortic strips. Iloprost (1-1000 nM) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of phenylephrine (1-6 microM) contractions, the responses being unaffected by pre-incubation with  SQ22536 (100 microM) for 30 min. In other experiments 60 nM iloprost caused a 64% inhibition of phenylephrine contractions concomitant with a 3 fold rise in cyclic AMP. SQ22536 completely abolished the iloprost-induced elevation in cyclic AMP while having no significant effect on relaxation. Our results therefore strongly  suggest that cyclic AMP-independent pathways are responsible for the vasorelaxant effects of iloprost in guinea-pig aorta.
