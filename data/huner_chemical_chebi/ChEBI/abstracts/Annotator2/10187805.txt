The 55-kDa receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TR55) triggers multiple signaling  cascades initiated by adapter proteins like TRADD and FAN. By use of the primary  amine monodansylcadaverine (MDC), we addressed the functional role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor internalization for intracellular signal distribution. We show that MDC does not prevent the interaction of the p55 TNF receptor (TR55) with FAN and TRADD. Furthermore, the activation of plasmamembrane-associated neutral sphingomyelinase activation as well as the stimulation of proline-directed protein kinases were not affected in MDC-treated  cells. In contrast, activation of signaling enzymes that are linked to the "death domain" of TR55, like acid sphingomyelinase and c-Jun-N-terminal protein kinase as well as TNF signaling of apoptosis in U937 and L929 cells, are blocked in the  presence of MDC. The results of our study suggest a role of TR55 internalization  for the activation of select TR55 death domain signaling pathways including those leading to apoptosis.
