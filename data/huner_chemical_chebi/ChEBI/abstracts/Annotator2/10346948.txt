Six new (1-6) and three known (7-9) sesquiterpene esters were isolated from the roots of Celastrus orbiculatus. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated as 1beta-acetoxy-6alpha-furoyloxy-9alpha-benzoyl oxydihydro-beta-agarofur an (1), 1beta-acetoxy-6alpha-benzoyloxy-9alpha-furoyloxydih ydro-beta-agarofur an (2), 1beta-acetoxy-6alpha, 9alpha-difuroyloxydihydro-beta-agarofuran (3), 1beta, 2beta-diacetoxy-6alpha-furoyloxy-9alpha-benzo yloxydihydro-beta-agarof uran (4),  1beta-acetoxy-2beta, 6alpha-difuroyloxy-9alpha-benzoyloxydihydro-beta -agarofuran (5), and 1beta-acetoxy-2beta,6alpha, 9alpha-tribenzoyloxydihydro-beta-agarofuran  (6). Compounds 4, 5, and 7-9 were shown to be more active than verapamil in reversing vinblastine resistance in multidrug-resistant KB-V1 cells.
