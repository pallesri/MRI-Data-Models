The authors attempted to evaluate different reagents in order to quantify the amino groups of the platelet membrane. The study was carried out by the action of different aldehydes and acid anhydrides. The use of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid made possible an approach by electrophoresis and chemical assay. The results showed an increase in the surface charge corresponding to a mean number of amino  groups varying from 1.86.10(5) groups with citraconic acid to 3.94.10(5) groups with acetaldehyde.
