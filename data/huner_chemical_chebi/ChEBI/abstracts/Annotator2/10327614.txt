Microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent lauric acid hydroxylase activities were characterized in liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa of the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Microsomes from these organs generated (omega-1)-hydroxylauric acid and a mixture of positional isomers including (omega)-, (omega-2)-, (omega-3)- and (omega-4)-hydroxylauric acids, which were identified by RP-HPLC and GC-MS analysis. Peroxisome proliferators, such as clofibrate and especially di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, increased kidney microsomal lauric acid hydroxylase activities. The synthesis of 11-hydroxylauric acid was enhanced 5.3-fold in kidney microsomes. Liver microsomal lauric acid hydroxylase  activities were weakly affected and no significant induction was found in small intestine microsomes from clofibrate or di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate-treated fish.  The differences in lauric acid metabolisation and the tissue-specific induction by peroxisome proliferators suggest the involvement of several P450s in this reaction. Incubations of liver and kidney microsomes with lauric acid analogues (11- or 10-dodecynoic acids) resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent loss of lauric acid hydroxylase activities. The induction of these activities in fish  by phthalates, which are widely-distributed environmental pollutants, may be taken into consideration for the development of new biomarkers.
