Ethylene-di-bromide is a popular fumigant. Delayed long-term effects of this chemical include carcinogenicity and genotoxicity in animals. Only a few cases of acute ethylene-di-bromide toxicity have been reported and all of them have resulted in a fatal outcome. We report the first case of ethylene-di-bromide poisoning presenting with acute renal failure and toxic hepatitis that was managed successfully.
