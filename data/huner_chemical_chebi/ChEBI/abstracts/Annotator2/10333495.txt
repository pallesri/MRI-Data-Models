A novel type of NADPH-dependent sepiapterin reductase, which catalysed uniquely the reduction of sepiapterin to l-threo-dihydrobiopterin, was purified 533-fold from the cytosolic fraction of Chlorobium tepidum, with an overall yield of 3%. The native enzyme had a molecular mass of 55 kDa and SDS/PAGE revealed that the enzyme consists of two subunits with a molecular mass of 26 kDa. The enzyme was optimally active at pH8.8 and 50 degrees C. Apparent Km values for sepiapterin and NADPH were 21 and 6.2 microM, respectively, and the kcat value was 5.0 s-1. Diacetyl could also serve as a substrate, with a Km of 4.0 mM. The inhibitory effects of N-acetylserotonin, N-acetyldopamine and melatonin were very weak. The  Ki value of N-acetyldopamine was measured as 400 microM. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was revealed as Met-Lys-His-Ile-Leu-Leu-Ile-Thr-Gly-Ala-Xaa-Lys - Lys - Ile - Xaa - Arg - Ala - Ile - Ala - Leu - Glu - Xaa - Ala - Arg - Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-His-His-His-, which shared relatively high sequence similarity with other sepiapterin reductases.
