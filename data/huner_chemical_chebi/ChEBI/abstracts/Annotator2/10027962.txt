Diazaborine and isoniazid are, at first sight, unrelated anti-bacterial agents that inhibit the enoyl-ACP reductase (ENR) of Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium  tuberculosis respectively. The crystal structures of these enzymes including that of the diazaborine-inhibited E. coli ENR have been obtained at high resolution. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the importance of amino acid residues in diazaborine susceptibility and enzyme function. The results show that drug binding and inhibition require the presence of a glycine residue at position 93 of E. coli ENR or at the structurally equivalent position in the plant homologue, which is naturally resistant to the drug. The data confirm the hypothesis that any amino acid side-chain other than hydrogen at this position within the three-dimensional structure of these enzymes will affect diazaborine resistance by encroaching into the drug binding site. Substitutions of Gly-93 by amino acids with small side-chains, such as serine, alanine, cysteine and valine, hardly affected the catalytic parameters and rendered the bacterial host resistant to the drug. Larger amino acid side-chains, such as that of arginine, histidine, lysine and glutamine, completely inactivated the activity of the enzyme.
