Previous studies have indicated that part of the binding of [3H] [1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy)ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine dihydrochloride] ([3H]GBR 12935) to human platelets is to a piperazine acceptor site, which might  be associated with cytochrome P-450IID6 (CYP4502D6, debrisoquine-4-hydroxylase).  Due to mutant CYP4502D6 alleles, 5-10% of Caucasians are poor metabolizers of CYP4502D6 substrates such as debrisoquine and dextromethorphan. In the present study, possible differences in binding characteristics of [3H]GBR 12935 in platelets from CYP4502D6 poor and extensive metabolizers were investigated. The most prominent finding was a gender difference, with males having significantly higher Kd values than females. There were no differences in Bmax. After correction for gender, there was a tendency towards higher Kd values in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers, although the difference was not statistically significant. Whether this finding corresponds to reduced CYP4502D6  activity is a matter of further investigation.
