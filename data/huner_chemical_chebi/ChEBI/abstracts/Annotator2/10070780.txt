The FM4-64, a member of the family of fluorescent dyes, has been applied to the cerebellar cortex to evaluate its properties as an intracellular stain and intracortical tracer. Slabs of hamster cerebellum, 1-2 mm thick, were incubated in 10, 30, and 100 microns solutions of FM4-64 in sodium phosphate buffer and observed in a slow scan confocal laser scanning microscope. Mossy and climbing fibers were traced in the cerebellar white and gray substances. They exhibited a  high fluorescence signal at the level of the myelin sheath. Mossy fibers were identified in the granular layer by their typical rosette formation and dichotomous bifurcation pattern. Climbing fiber bundles were observed crossing the granular layer and giving collateral branches around Golgi cell bodies. They  ascend to the Purkinje cell layer on their way to the molecular layer. Cerebellar macroneurons (Golgi and Purkinje cells) and microneurons (granule, basket, and stellate cells) showed optimal intracellular staining of cell soma, axonal, and dendritic processes. The z-series of stacks of optodigital sections allowed us to explore in depth the cytoarchitectonic arrangement, nerve and glial cell morphology, and the topographic relationship with the afferent fibers.
