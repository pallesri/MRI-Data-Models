The effect of thirteen different fungal azaphilones, which have a common 6-iso-chromane-like ring, was tested on cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity in vitro. Chaetoviridin B showed the most potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of < 6.2 microM, followed by sclerotiorin with an IC50 value of 19.4 microM. Rotiorin, chaetoviridin A and rubrorotiorin had moderate inhibitory activity (IC50 ; 30 approximately 40 microM), but others showed very weak or no inhibitory activity. The relationship between the structures and their inhibitory activity indicated that the presence of an electrophilic ketone(s) and/or enone(s) at both C-6 and C-8 positions in the isochromane-like ring is essential for eliciting CETP inhibitory activity. The transfer activity of both CE and TG was inhibited by sclerotiorin to approximately the same extent (IC50: 14.4 and 10.3 microM, respectively). A model of the reaction suggested that sclerotiorin reacts with a primary amine of amino acids such as lysine in the protein to form a covalent bond.
