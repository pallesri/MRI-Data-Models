Mr.	O

thought	O

a	O
pseudomonal	O

Both	O

these	O
etiologies	O
were	O
treated	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
continued	O
to	O
oxygenate	O
and	O
ventilate	O
well	O
on	O
his	O
usual	O
ventilator	O
settings	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
issue	O
that	O
dominated	O
the	O
admission	O
was	O
his	O
recent	O
acute	O
decline	O
in	O
mental	O
status	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
thoroughly	O

account	O
for	O
his	O

,	O
severe	O

this	O

likely	O
anoxic	O

,	O
for	O
which	O
the	O
prognosis	O
is	O

This	O
was	O

The	O

that	O

1.	O
Hypotension	O

The	O

initially	O
mildly	O
hypotensive	O
with	O
systolic	B-procedure
blood	I-procedure

in	O
the	O
80s	O

Upon	O

it	O

the	O
patient	O
was	O
volume	O

volume	O
depleted	O

Initially	O
he	O

However	O

it	O
was	O
determined	O
that	O
the	O
patient	O

hypotension	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
related	O
to	O
his	O
rapid	O

Therefore	O
the	O
