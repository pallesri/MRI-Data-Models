Oxyresveratrol is a potent antioxidant and free-radical scavenger found in mulberry wood (Morus alba L.) with demonstrated protective effects against cerebral ischemia. We analyzed the neuroprotective ability of oxyresveratrol using an in vitro model of stretch-induced trauma in co-cultures of neurons and glia, or by exposing cultures to high levels of glutamate. Cultures were treated with 25  M, 50  M or 100  M oxyresveratrol at the time of injury. Trauma produced marked neuronal death when measured 24 h post-injury, and oxyresveratrol significantly inhibited this death. Microscopic examination of glia suggested signs of toxicity in cultures treated with 100  M oxyresveratrol, as demonstrated by elevated S-100B protein release and a high proportion of cells with condensed nuclei. Cultures exposed to glutamate (100  M) for 24 h exhibited ~ 37% neuronal loss, which was not inhibited by oxyresveratrol. These results show that the two pathologies of high glutamate exposure and trauma are differentially affected by oxyresveratrol treatment in vitro. Further studies using oxyresveratrol in trauma models are warranted, as toxicity to glia could be beneficial by inhibiting reactive gliosis, which often occurs after trauma.
