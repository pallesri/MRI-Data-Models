Rice bran, the outer bran and germ of the kernel and a by-product of rice milling, is rich in phytonutrients but has been underutilized because of lipid content instability. New methods for the processing of rice bran have yielded a stabilized form that is increasingly used in foods and dietary supplements. Recent studies have documented a role for stabilized rice bran (SRB) in treating diabetes and arthritis, although little is known of the bioactive compounds that impart these health benefits. Here we characterize the chemical composition of three extracts of SRB and identify the functional bioactives contributing to the inhibitory properties against three key pro-inflammatory enzymes (cyclooxygenase [COX] 1, COX2, and 5-lipoxygenase [5-LOX]) that control the inflammatory cascade involved in impaired joint health, pain, and arthritis. One extract (SRB-AI) demonstrated significant COX1 and COX2 inhibitory activities with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for COX1 and COX2 of 305 and 29 microg/mL, respectively, but no 5-LOX inhibition. The second extract (SRB-AII) inhibited COX1, COX2, and 5-LOX with IC(50) values of 310, 19, and 396 microg/mL, respectively. The third extract (SRB-AIII), a blend of SRB-AI and SRB-AIII, inhibited COX1, COX2, and 5-LOX with respective IC(50) values of 48, 11, and 197 microg/mL. Analysis of the extracts by direct analysis in real time time of flight-mass spectrometry revealed that SRB-AI, SRB-AII, and SRB-AIII contain over 620, 770, and 810 compounds, respectively. Of these, 17 were identified as key bioactives for COX and/or LOX inhibition. These SRB extracts have applications for functional foods and dietary supplements for control of inflammation and joint health.
