In 10 separate experiments, mice with established chemically induced or UV light-induced skin papillomas were treated continuously with green tea in the drinking water or with i.p. injections of a green tea polyphenol fraction or (-)-epigallocatechin gallate three times a week for 4-10 weeks. Partial tumor regression or > 90% inhibition of tumor growth, as measured by changes in tumor volume per mouse, was observed in 5 experiments, and marked inhibition of tumor growth (46-89%) was observed in 5 additional experiments. Treatment of the mice with green tea or green tea constituents had an inhibitory effect on body weight increases in several but not all of the studies. Examination of the data from all ten experiments revealed that complete tumor regression occurred in 14 of 346 papilloma-bearing mice (4%) that were treated with green tea in the drinking water or with i.p. injections of green tea constituents, whereas none of the 220 papilloma-bearing control mice treated with only vehicle exhibited complete tumor regression. These observations indicate that oral administration of green tea, i.p. administration of a green tea polyphenol fraction, or i.p. administration of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate inhibited the growth and/or caused the regression of established experimentally induced skin papillomas.
