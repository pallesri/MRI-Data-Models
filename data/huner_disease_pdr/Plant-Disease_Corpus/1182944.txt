The mechanism by which magnesium affects digitalis-induced arrhythmias was studied in dogs with and without beta-receptor blockade. Digoxin was infused at a rate of 2.5mug/kg/min until ventricular tachycardia developed, then half the animals were given MgSO4, the other half saline. In animals given MgSO4, sinus rhythm was immediately re-established; in animals given saline, ventricular tachycardia persisted. In animals with beta-receptor blockade, MgSO4 was as effective in abolishing ventricular tachycardia as in those without beta-receptor blockade. We found no evidence that magnesium re-activated digoxin-inhibited (Na+, K+)-ATPase, altered myocardial or microsomal digoxin binding, or acted via the autonomic nervous system. Magnesium's direct effect on calcium and potassium fluxes across the myocardial cell membrane may be the mechanism of its antiarrhythmic action in digitalis-toxic arrhythmias.
