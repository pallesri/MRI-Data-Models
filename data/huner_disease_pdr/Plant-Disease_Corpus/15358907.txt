With the highest tobacco abuse prevalence among all minorities, American Indians incur high rates of tobacco-related cancers. As a people, we have the poorest survival rate from cancer of any racial or ethnic group, due to a lack of access to specialist care and to low socioeconomic status (http://info.his.gov). With such epidemic abuse of commercial tobacco, we continuously lose our elders, adults, and children to disease and premature death. Therefore, it is essential to investigate theories of prevention, addiction, and cessation specifically related to our ethnicity. The authors of this article discuss past research wrongs and highlight culturally competent research strategies to aid Native communities in tobacco abuse prevention and education. The authors hope to contribute to bridging the gap between culturally relevant research and culturally relevant health promotion.
