THE AIM OF THIS STUDY: was to assess the anti-inflammatory and mechanism of action of Allanblackia monticola (Guttiferae). The anti-inflammatory activity "in vivo" of the methylene chloride/methanol extract, methanol and methylene chloride fractions of stem barks of Allanblackia monticola, administered orally at doses of 37.5; 75; 150 and 300 mg/kg, was evaluated on carrageenan-induced oedema in rats to determine the most active fraction. Indomethacin, inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase was used as reference drug. The effects of the most active fraction were then examined on the rat paw oedema caused by histamine, serotonin, arachidonic acid and dextran followed by its ulcerogenic effect. The results showed that the methylene chloride fraction of Allanblackia monticola was more effective on the oedema caused by the carrageenan. The anti-nociceptive activity of the methylene chloride fraction was assessed using the acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction model, formalin test and hot plate test. At 150 mg/kg, Allanblackia monticola caused maximum inhibitions of inflammation induced by carrageenan (83.33%), by histamine (42.10%), by dextran (40.29%) and by arachidonic acid (64.28%). Allanblackia monticola (75-300 mg/kg) did not cause significant modification of the oedema induced by serotonin. Concerning the anti-nociceptive properties of the plant, the methylene chloride fraction (75-300 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent inhibition on abdominal contractions induced by acetic acid (32.34-77.37%) and significantly inhibited the inflammatory pain caused by formalin (40.71-64.78%). Allanblackia monticola did not increase the latency time in the hot plate test. Like indomethacin (10mg/kg), the fraction at the dose of 150 mg/kg caused ulceration of the gastric mucous membrane in treated rats. These results show that Allanblackia monticola has an anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities with gastric ulcerative side effects.
