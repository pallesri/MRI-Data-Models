Chronic consumption of alcohol is an accepted social custom worldwide. In the upper aerodigestive tract, local morphologic, metabolic and functional alterations can be present due such consumption. Gastroesophageal reflux or alterations in sleep structure are typical examples of functional disorders. While alcohol was initially described as a risk enhancer only in smokers, a number of epidemiological studies have now shown that chronic alcohol consumption increases the risk of head and neck cancer independently of exposure to tobacco smoke. In addition, alcohol leads to an accumulation of pathologic microbes within the mucosa, leading to chronic infection. Susceptibility to carcinogens and cell proliferation in the mucosa are increased, resulting in genetic changes with the development of dysplasia, leucoplakia and carcinoma. Chronic alcohol consumption is correlated with an increased risk of cancer and increased mortality in a dose-dependent relationship. A number of biologically plausible mechanisms exist by which alcohol may cause cancer.
