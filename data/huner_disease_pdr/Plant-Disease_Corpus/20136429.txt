Lipid-soluble ginseng extract was prepared by n-hexane extraction of red ginseng. BALB/c-nu mice were inoculated with human lung cancer (NCI-H460) cells to establish a human tumor xenograft model in nude mice, and the lipid-soluble ginseng extract was orally administered. The tumor inhibitory rates of the lipid-soluble ginseng extract at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 g/kg/day were 18.9% (P < .05), 60.0% (P < .001), and 67.5% (P < .001), respectively. The oral administration of the lipid-soluble extract of red ginseng showed a potent anticancer effect in nude mice bearing human lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner without any apparent toxicity. This lipid-soluble ginseng extract is a potential nontoxic anticancer supplement for the prevention and intervention of lung tumor growth through an oral administration route.
