BACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhea can be challenging to manage in captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) leading to ongoing diagnostics, medications, monitoring, and potential euthanasia. Coconut has been used as a dietary supplement for people with inflammatory bowel disease, with anecdotal reports of decreased diarrhea following the dietary addition. A dietary trial in rhesus macaques was initiated to evaluate the hypothesis that dietary coconut decreases symptoms of chronic diarrhea in rhesus macaques. METHODS: Ten rhesus macaques with chronic diarrhea were selected for the trial. Five of the subjects were fed coconut macaroons and five of the subjects were fed a sham cookie. Stool consistency was monitored daily for both groups. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Data of chi-squared analysis obtained from eight rhesus macaques with chronic diarrhea showed that the use of coconut macaroons as a dietary supplement did not have a statistically significant effect on their diarrhea.
