The efficiency of some polysaccharides was investigated in mice with an experimental toxic hepatitis. Hepatitis was induced by the oral administration of 10% solution CCl4 in olive oil at a dosage of 3 ml/kg body weight every day during 7 days. After that tested substances were administrated every day 30-40 min before a feeding at a dosage of 150 mg/kg body weight during 14-21 days. Results showed that a calcium alginate, two low-methoxyl pectins (one with the degree of esterification about 50% and other with the degree of esterification less 5%), fucoidan, and chitozan, but not lambda-carrageenan and kappa-carrageenan, have beneficial affects on liver total lipid, glycogen, malondialdehyde, and diene conjugates as well as on blood total lipid and alanine aminotransferase activity in animals with experimental toxic hepatitis.
