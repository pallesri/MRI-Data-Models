OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic effect of Lespedeza Michx in experimental rat model of minimal change nephropathy (MCN). METHOD: The rat MCN model was reproduced by tail-intravenous injection of Adriamycin. The treatment effect of Lespedeza Michx was determined by the detection of urine protein collection for 24 hours, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ATCO, IL-8, TNF-alpha in serum, and renal histopathological changes were observed by microscope. RESULT: Lespedeza Michx could decrease the contents of urine proteinuria, MDA, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in serum, increase SOD level and improved the pathological change of glomeruli. CONCLUSION: Lespedeza Michx was effective on MCN.
