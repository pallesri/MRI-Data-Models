The ethanol extract from the dried exudate of Bursera fagaroides (Burseraceae) showed significant cytotoxic activity in the HT-29 (human colon adenocarcinoma) test system. The extract provided four podophyllotoxin related lignans, identified as (7'R,8R,8'R)-(-)-deoxypodophyllotoxin (3), (7'R,8R,8'R)-(-)-morelensin (4), (8R,8'R)-(-)-yatein (5), and (8R,8'R)-(-)-5'-desmethoxyyatein (6), whose spectroscopic and chiroptical properties were compared with those of (7R,7'R,8R,8'R)-(-)-podophyllotoxin (1) and its acetyl derivative (2). Their absolute configurations were assigned by comparison of the vibrational circular dichroism spectra of 1 and 3 with those obtained by density functional theory calculations.
