The occurrence of multilocular malignant tumors in the upper aerodigestive tract in young patients with known marijuana abuse has been described by other authors. A case of a 28-year-old man who was known to abuse alcohol, nicotine and cannabis for some years is presented. He suffered simultaneously from a squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx with bilateral cervical metastases, an adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon and a primary hepatocellular carcinoma. This case is the first reported that shows the occurrence of three separate malignant tumors with different histologies in the aerodigestive tract which could be related to a chronic abuse of cannabis.
