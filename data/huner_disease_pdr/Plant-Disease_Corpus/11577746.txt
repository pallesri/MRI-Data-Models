A coffee extract significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatitis in D-galactosamine-sensitized rats, as assessed by the plasma alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities, when it was added to the diet (30 g/kg) and fed to rats for 14 days. Its effect was as strong as that of a green tea extract. The coffee extract suppressed LPS-induced hepatitis when singly force-fed (1.2 g/kg) 1.5 h prior to the injection of the drugs, whereas a decaffeinated coffee extract had no significant effect. The hepatoprotective effect of caffeine was stronger than that of theobromine. These results indicate that coffee can protect animals from LPS-induced hepatitis, and that the effect of coffee might be mainly due to caffeine.
