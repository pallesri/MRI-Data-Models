The effectiveness of Sabal serrulata (dwarf palm) extract was evaluated in the treatment of 38 patients with symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia. During a 12-month treatment controlled by investigations the subjective symptoms decreased in nearly three fourth of the patients. Side effects were not observed. According to uroflowmetric investigations the average peak flow value increased from 10.36 ml/sec to 14.44 ml/sec (p < 0.0001) and the average mean flow value from 0.02 ml/sec to 7.45 ml/sec (p < 0.001). After treatment residual urine volume decreased or was nil in more than 9/10 of the cases. The average decrease of residue was 47 ml (p < 0.001). The average decrease in prostatic volume was 10.6% (p < 0.02). On the basis of their favorable experience the authors recommend the administration of Sabal serrulata extract in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia.
