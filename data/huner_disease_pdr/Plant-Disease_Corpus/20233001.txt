BACKGROUND: In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that Nigella Sativa (NS) has protective effects against ischemia reperfusion injury on various organs. However, its protective effects on intestinal tissue against ischemia reperfusion injury are unclear. We aimed to determine whether NS prevents intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty rats were divided into three groups as sham (group 1), control (group 2), and NS-treatment group (group 3). All rats underwent intestinal ischemia for 60 min followed by a 60-min period of reperfusion. Rats were intraperitoneally infused only 0.9% saline solutions in group 2. Rats in the group 3 received NS (0,2 mL/kg) intraperitoneally, before ischemia and before reperfusion. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT), total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in ileum tissue were measured. Also, ileum tissue histopathology was evaluated by a light microscope. RESULTS: The levels of liver enzymes in group 3 were significantly lower than those in group 2 (p <.01). TAC and CAT activity levels in ileum tissue were significantly higher in group 3 than in group 2. TOS, OSI, and MPO in ileum tissue were significantly lower in group 3 than group 2 (p <.05 for TOS and MPO; p < .01 for OSI). Histological tissue damage was milder in the NS treatment group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that NS treatment protected the rat's intestinal tissue against intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury.
