Questionnaires on smokeless tobacco use were completed by 781 sixth grade students in 15 schools at six locations in the United States. The students were both American Indian-Alaska Native and non-American Indian-Alaska Native. The Indian and Alaska Native schoolchildren were experimenting with and regularly using smokeless tobacco at higher rates that non-Indian schoolchildren. At Indian Health Service sites, 28.1 percent of the children reported current use of smokeless tobacco, compared with 3.3 percent of the children elsewhere. For girls reporting smokeless tobacco experimentation, the comparison was 68.9 percent at Indian Health Service sites and 8.7 percent at non-Indian sites; for boys, it was 79.1 percent from the Indian sites and 35.4 percent from the non-Indian sites. For those students who had tried smokeless tobacco, more than half also reported having tried cigarettes. The majority of all sixth grade students surveyed were aware of the health risks of smokeless tobacco use in that it is an increased risk for cancer. Additional research is needed to determine appropriate interventions.
