BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) consist of an uncontrolled intestinal inflammation leading to mucosal disruption. This inflammation is accompanied by an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Polyphenols are micronutrients with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and may play an interesting role in the prevention of intestinal inflammation. Lemon verbena (Aloysia triphylla) infusion is a popular herbal infusion rich in polyphenols (flavones and verbascoside). AIMS: This study evaluated the preventive effects of lemon verbena infusion consumption against mild-to-moderate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. METHODS: Wistar rats drank water or lemon verbena infusion for 14 days. On day 15, half of the rats received DSS (4%) in their drink for 7 days. At the end of the experimental period, the colon was taken for histopathological examination and determination of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], glutathione reductase [GR], catalase [CAT]), glutathione and lipid peroxidation. Lymphocyte populations were determined in blood, mesenteric nodes and Peyer's patches. RESULTS: Rats ingested daily 5.6  mol of polyphenols. DSS reduced food intake and induced colitis, as reflected by histological lesions and increased MPO activity. Although these alterations were not significantly counteracted by lemon verbena consumption, the herbal infusion increased colonic SOD activity and decreased lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde). Other oxidative stress markers (GPx, GR, CAT, glutathione) were not significantly modified. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the preventive consumption of lemon verbena infusion offered some antioxidative protection during experimental colitis by stimulating SOD activity and decreasing lipid peroxidation.
