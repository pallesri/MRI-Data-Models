Excess aluminum (Al) exposure impairs neurocognitive function in humans and animals. Epidemiologic studies have shown a potential link between chronic Al exposure and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we sought to evaluate the protective effects of the herbal medicine Dipsacus asper extract against the cognitive impairment and overexpression of hippocampal beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) induced by chronic Al exposure in rats. Vitamin E (VE) was used as a positive control. Following exposure to 0.3% aluminum chloride (AlCl(3)) solution for 90 days in their drinking water, animals displayed a striking decrease (>80%) in step-through latency in the passive avoidance task and a significant increase (123%) in the number of Abeta immunoreactive cells in the hippocampus compared to controls. Al-exposed animals were then randomly assigned to receive vehicle, Dipsacus asper extract (4 g/kg), or VE (40 mg/kg) treatment up to 5 months. Both Dipsacus asper extract and VE significantly ameliorated animal's performance impairment in the passive avoidance task and suppressed the overexpression of hippocampal Abeta immunoreactivity. The effects of Dipsacus asper extract, but not VE, increased with time of treatment. The present results suggest that Dipsacus asper extract may possess therapeutic effects against Alzheimer's disease.
