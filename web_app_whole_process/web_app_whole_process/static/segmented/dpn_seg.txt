Daily Progress Notes The SOAP note 
Progress notes are to be written by the r esident or  intern on each  covered medical patien t 
on a daily b asis. The daily progress note serves as a  written medical-legal docu ment  that:  
  Serves as a record of a patien ts hospitalization   
  Must be completed on a Daily basis and in cludes all  events  that o ccur during 
the hospitalization   
  Records even ts in terms of subjective and ob jectiv e findings  
  Must include new and  active patient h ealth/social iss ues problems   
  Each problem is ev aluat ed/assessed and an  appropriate plan  is formulated  
  Must be legible and well written so to avoid any  mis understanding by th e reader  
  Must have a time and d ate and b e signed on each pag e by the au thor in legible 
fashion. 
The daily progress note is tr aditionally organized as  a SOAP Note. Many, however, 
organize  the Progress note as HS OAP where th e  H stands for history and contains  one 
or two sentences summarizing the patien ts case.  
 

==========
Subjective: 
  Record of subjective f indings that occurred dur ing th e evening , ov ernight, 
and in the  morning th at patien t is being ex amed.  
  Essentially how the patien t felt during the  evening, n ight time and 
morning hours and what happ ened during  those hours.

Objective:   

==========
  Physical Exam: Vital signs, focused physical exam b ut  almost  always 
should include : 
  LUNG 
  CARDIAC 
  ABDOMINAL 
  EXTREMITIES  
  Laboratory d ata  
  Diagnostic Imaging  
  Microbiology  
  Please note  that  a Medicat ion List  which includes a listing of all 
scheduled and PRN as needed  medications that  are  relevan t to active 
problems is always helpful and r ecommended but  is not required.

A/P: 
 
  THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR NOTE  
  The Assessment section of  the progress note should  be organized by 
problems. Thus writing  a problem list on  the margin  of the progress note 
is helpful in org anizing your note bu t is not always necessary. Problems 
must be included in your  assessment.   
  Assess each problem and in clude relevan t differ ential diagnosis, evid ence 
suggesting or not suggesting a d iagnosis. It is essentially what do you 
think caused  the problem & why do you th ink that.   
  Once the assessment h as been mad e a plan must be  f ormulated to addr ess 
each problem see below.  Plan should be co mplete  and those who read 
your note should know exactly what you  are doing and why.  
  Some secondary problems are stab le and do no t need  an assessment but 
rather just  a plan see b elow.  
 

==========
Assessment and Plan: 
1. Chest Pain:  Differential diagnoses remain broad  with exact etiology 
still unclear.  Most con cerning at th is time r emains pericard itis because of 
the natur e of chest pain and EK G chang es. Acute cor onary syndrome 
remains in d ifferen tial bu t is less likely giv en the nor mal cardiac enzymes 
and the nature of th e EKG ch anges.  PE is very unlik ely given  the normal 
oxygenation  and comp lete lack of r isk factors.  Dissection is unlikely  as 
the patient h as no history of HTN and symmetric blo od pressures.  
 
If w/u for above lif e threatening  causes negative will further expand 
differential  to include GI,  infectious, musculoskeltal  and other causes of 
chest pain.  
 

==========
Plan: 
  Serial EK G 
  Stat ECHO 
  Follow cardiac enzy mes  
  Morphine for pain con trol  
  Continue ASA 
  Hold Beta Blo cker as SBP 100 and HR 60 
    Consider cardio logy consult d epending on abov e workup 
 
2. Mild Anemia:  Differen tial diagnoses includes:  decreased production, 
sequestration, d estruction/loss.  At this time  most co ncerning is occult  GI 
blood loss given the p atients guaiac positive stools and  microcy tic  indices. 
Plan: 
Needs routine health screening co lonoscopy as age 
recommended.    
Check FE studies  
Follow serial HCT ch eck daily   
 
3. Tobacco  abuse: Smoking  cessation counseling  
 
4.  Code:  Fu ll 
 
5.  FEN:  Card iac prud ent diet  
 
13.  Disposition:  No plans for D/C within n ext 24 h ours.
